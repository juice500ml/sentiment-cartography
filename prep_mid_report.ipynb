I was picturing glossy black grand pianos with glittering notes, pianists in black jackets and crystal glasses full of red wine. I am really, really glad I was wrong. \\\\n\\\\nIt was gritty, bawdy and quintessentially Pittsburgh. First off, the pianos are scuffed to hell, considering the number of tipsy people who sit on them nightly while being mildly humiliated. The musicians hammer away at them, and they\\'re covered with N@ and Sing Sing stickers. It\\'s obvious they\\'ve been well-loved. The music is anything but the elevator music I was picturing; it\\'s rock, hip-hop, oldies, pop, and just about any genre imaginable thanks to the request system (send up a piece of paper with some money) and the amazing repertoire of the musicians. For instance, \\\\\"Rubber Ducky\\\\\" and \\\\\"Gangsta\\'s Paradise\\\\\" were both featured when I was there, and both performed impeccably. They also honored a request for a Taylor Swift song only to receive $30 and a request for \\\\\"anything else,\\\\\" which they promptly followed. The musicians also do funny versions of popular songs, and throw in things like \\\\\"yinz\\\\\" instead of \\\\\"you.\\\\\"\\\\n\\\\nI saw in awe of the performers for a decent portion of the night. It must take a particularly special type of person to put on a show like this, considering the energy, confidence, wit, empathy, boldness, silliness, cleverness, and sheer talent a job like this requires. They rotate performers in and out so there\\'s not even an intermission. I\\'ve read comments about the baseness of the humor, but I had no doubt the guys up on stage were intelligent dudes. They had great personalities: one was about 140 pounds, cheeky, and quick-witted. He acted out every sport in the winter olympics, and was pretty into this 90-something-year-old lady in the audience called Joan. The other had crazy hair and bright blue Chucks, beatboxed as well as he sang, and made it point to play a handful of songs for my friend\\'s birthday. \\\\\"I think Ray Charles is the most soulful guy of all time,\\\\\" he said when she requested him.\\\\n\\\\nThere were tons of people celebrating birthdays, and one big bachelorette party the Saturday night I was there. The performers bring the birthday boy/girl, bachelor/bachelorette, etc. on stage (for a $20 tip, which is pretty easy to scrounge up among friends) and humiliate the hell out of them, i.e. this is not the place to be if you can\\'t laugh at yourself. My friend had a short dress on when she sat on the piano, and they sang a three-minute song about her vagina.\\\\n\\\\nLuckily, the show eclipsed the bad service and overpriced, weak drinks, because those did feature heavily throughout the night. The rest of the staff was friendly, however, and I stumbled on the door guy singing and dancing by himself, which made me smile.\\\\n\\\\nSing Sing is definitely not an every weekend type of thing (much like Hofbr\\\\u00e4uhaus), but is a splendid way to celebrate a special occasion. Definitely belongs on every required Pittsburgh experiences list.',\n",

It was DISGUSTING.  There was so much dressing dripping off of this dish, it was more like a soup than a salad.  I suspect that the lettuce was so wilted and brown, they figured they could disguise it by completely soaking it in dressing.  Not only was it disgusting, but it cost us about $10.  $10 for complete inedible slop.  \\\\n\\\\nThe \\\\\"numero uno\\\\\" pizza we got was nothing to write home about either.

I took a bite of the soup and it was somewhat better than the other soup, but it was still brown.  I ate half the bowl and left the rest for the server.  It was thick and gooey and the flavor didn't wow.  I saw no reason to continue.  I moved on to the dumplings, which had an okay flavor to them.  The skins were a bit thick and doughy.  The meat on the inside did not balance this attribute at all.  The sauce tasted a little odd so I tried to remix and it was still off.  I tried the components individually and found that some of them were either old, stale, or rancid.  We finished our dumplings.\\\\n\\\\nOur lunch entrees arrived.  I had ordered mine extra-spicy, but I guess it came Pittsburgh Hot (super mild) and had a lackluster flavor at best.  The meat was tough and the sauce tasted of soy sauce more than anything else.  I tried some of Chang's chicken and was equally mollified.  This was supposed to be their version of General Tso's Chicken.  Now I have never had a General's chicken that was the same at any place.  It is always different.  Many of them are good in different ways.  This food, though, it wasn't good.  Chang's chicken fell into the same category as the Sesame Chicken -- since it tasted mainly of soy sauce -- with the addition sugar.  \\\\n\\\\nI just don't understand how anyone can like this place.  Even the Yoshida Sauce you get at Sam's/Costco tastes better.\",\n",

I also ordered a cup of the mac & cheese, and it was awful. You know how when you reheat elbow mac & cheese in the microwave, and the cheese gets all greasy/gloopy and the noodles stick together? Well, it was exactly THAT, with some powdered garlic sprinked on top. Really. I should have made my own leftover mac at home and not paid $4 for a cup of that. Learn from my mistake.\\\\n\\\\nWe had planned to order milkshakes, too, but our server spent so much time in a black hole or something that by the time she finally returned, we\\'d been completely finished with our meal for at least 15 minutes. For $4 (and probably a ridiculous wait) per milkshake, we decided to hit The Milkshake Factory on East Carson instead.',\n",

They have valet parking which is great because it takes the stress out of trying to find parking.\\\\n\\\\nUpon entering I almost fainted at the smells and views of this place. Right when I walked in I saw an array of freshly prepared vegetables that were on a table in the kitchen area. It was beautiful and really made realize right then what kind of place this was. The service we had was second to none. Right from entering we were promptly seated and received an explanation of everything that was on the table for our enjoyment. The \\\\\"Holy Oil\\\\\" was ridiculous and almost addicting I couldn\\'t stop drowning the fresh bread in that stuff that I think I ruined my appetite.  Folks when you come here don\\'t eat lunch because the food dishes are huge. We ordered an appetizer of Mussels Diavolo which had a huge amount of decent mussels in a spicier tomato sauce. The sauce was really spicy and flavorful that I couldn\\'t waste it so I asked for more bread and took care of that. I think I should have come here with more people because already it was too much and too good just for two people. \\\\n\\\\nThen be prepared after your salad there is a pasta course, which I probably could have done without because I was approaching topped off. The pasta was in a vodka sauce that I could have been happy with for my main dinner.\\\\n\\\\nI then ordered the Filet Mignon, which was hands down the best piece of meat I have ever had in my life to date. They cooked it to my request of medium spot on,and the chunk of filet was so large that I can\\'t figure out how they cooked it so perfectly. Than it was covered in a red wine sauce with mushrooms that was savory to say the least. We both had to take most of our entrees home with us which was unfortunate because they were so awesome. Matter of fact I\\'m eating the side of bacon mashed potatoes this morning as I write this review.\\\\n\\\\nI did think that it might be hard to come here if you don\\'t eat meat because the menu on this Friday night was meat-tastic. They probably could make a pasta dish without might to suit ones requests but I don\\'t know for sure. Also I did think that the menu online was a little misleading as I thought that there would have been more pasta options on the particular night I was there. There was only one option when I was there and it had a sauce that contained two meats sausage and pork.\\\\n\\\\nI wish my bank account could handle more of this place, I will be back once I roll my wallet out of the ER.

The current special exhibit is the watches and timepieces from H.J. Heinz, including a stunning music box and watch piece.\\\\n\\\\nBut as much as I enjoy natural science, I really love art.  The Carnegie Museum of Art includes  American art from the late nineteenth century, French Impressionist and Post-Impressionist paintings, and European and American decorative arts.

He\\'s not a competition circuit smoker, not a modern restaurateur spreading his seed across Pittsburgh, and certainly no hipster chef serving ingredients grown in his rooftop garden.\\\\n\\\\nRibs. Chicken. Sauce.\\\\n\\\\nThe slow smoked spare ribs, sold by the plate size or full rack, are smoked just long enough to make the rib bones protrude from the top of the slab but not long enough so the meat is \\\\\"falling off the bone\\\\\"... tender and juicy, but enough bite to let you know that you\\'re eating the flesh off an animal.  The color and texture of the surface aren\\'t overwhelming in flavor but give you just enough crust and seasoning to let you experience the strata of bark / meat / fat.  For those that don\\'t like fat, you\\'ll complain about the ribs.  Spares have a tendency to hold a bit more fat within the meat fibers, particularly the section around the tips that are usually trimmed for a St. Louis cut.  you want low fat? Eat a pork loin or a handful of grass.\\\\n\\\\nThe chickens are halved and smoked right alongside the ribs. The skin had nice chew, a good simple rub, and cooked beyond the point of any gummy texture but not so long that it was a layer of armor surrounding the meat.  The dark meat was succulent and the white meat maintained just the right amount of moisture.\\\\n\\\\nAs requested, everything was served with the hot BBQ sauce.  Not mind blowingly hot, but a well rounded picquant flavor with a bit of black pepper on the tip of the tongue.  Tomato base with a bit of vinegar, good enough to compliment the meat and fat of both animals.\\\\n\\\\nAs for sides, the collard greens are tender and you\\'ll come across the occasional gold nugget of pork.  The coleslaw and macaroni salad are simple and a bit underseasoned, but when eaten in tandem with the meat and sauce they compliment everything just fine.

Or, she could have told us there was a problem but then politely taken care of it since it is her job and there wasn't much else going on for her to do.  Or she could have talked to someone in the first place and quietly resolved the matter without us even knowing there was a problem to begin with.  I later noticed signs up all over the place about restrictions with restaurant.com offers - I guess they have several patrons who use those regularly.  Apparently with this kind of reception, no one wants to pay full price.\\\\n\\\\nMom and I both ordered the fish sandwich with mac n cheese.  The mac n cheese was creamy and the fish sandwich was a large portion and very tasty.  I ended up having to eat mine with a knife and fork, not even attempting to lift and eat it as a sandwich.  We left with full and happy tummies.\\\\n\\\\nTo comment on previous reviews....yes, this is not the cleanest place.  But I expected that and find it part of the charm.  The smoke from the bar is no longer an issue as a closed door separates the bar area from the dining room.\\\\n\\\\nOverall, it was a larger than average portion for a good fish sandwich.  I'd like to give it 3 stars at least, but the whole attitude from the hostess still left a bad taste in my mouth that the mac n cheese couldn't wash away.\",\n",

I was sitting up in bed reading, and every time the people next door closed a drawer in their bureau the whole headboard would shake.\\\\n\\\\nParking was also expensive. We needed to use the car several times during our stay, so we had to valet park, which was over $20/day (plus tips each time we picked up or dropped off the car).\\\\n\\\\nThe coffee shop attached to the hotel is just OK. The breakfast/lunch place was not very good. You will probably have to venture a bit to find affordable and good quality food (other than the hotel restaurant, which I can't comment on because we did not eat there given the high prices).\\\\n\\\\nOne perk--the hotel does offer free internet, but it is a low bandwidth version. We didn't need the internet for work or anything so it was hard to justify paying for the high speed, so we used the free version. It gets the job done for email and web browsing, but it does not stream videos well.\\\\n\\\\nThe bed was comfortable and the shower head was very good. I agree with other reviewers that the amenities were not as nice as I have seen in other Westins--no bathrobe, room service menu not as good, staff not quite as helpful. Also, because it is a green hotel, they will be a little stingy about replenishing your towels and toiletries. If you have a lot of people in your room or for some other reason require extra supplies, be sure to request that. We came back after housekeeping to find that they had given us a half-full bottle of shampoo to replace the one we had used. Not sure if they had just gotten that from someone else's room (gross!) or it had just spilled and they didn't want to waste it.

They never looked especially busy (but then during theater times, I've rarely been anywhere downtown that really WAS 'especially busy') and we really didn't know anything about it.  So on this particular foray into a night with Lily Tomlin, we thought we'd try something different.\\\\n\\\\nI see all the growling reviews here complaining about...well...everything...from service to food, and frankly, I'm not quite sure we were all at the same restaurant.\\\\n\\\\nI'm also a bit confused by most people calling it 'Thai' when the menu says 'Cambodian'.\\\\n\\\\nLemon Grass was pleasant.  They did seem to operate with minimal staff, but they certainly seemed to keep up.  There was a small group of diners when we arrived, and that number grew while we were there, seemed like mostly people who were going to the same show we were.\\\\n\\\\nThe menu options were quite ethnic and unusual from things I'd seen on most Asian menus, which to me, was very cool. Couldn't pronounce them, but the ingredients were certainly unlike the others, so we decided to try a couple of dishes we'd never tried before, including an appetizer.\\\\n\\\\nThe appetizers were called 'Na Taings' and were like little non-sweet rice krispie treats that came with a very yummy pork and curry sauce to top them with.  There were five on the plate.  Several of their appetizers came 5 to the plate.  Ok folks, what is UP with the odd numbers on appetizer plates around here lately?  If you're sharing with another person, do we really want to incite a riot over who gets the last one?  Even Stevens is best on any shared plate.  Two for you, two for me, or three for you, three for me...not 'Oh no, you go ahead'  'No, YOU go ahead, really'.\\\\n\\\\nAnyway, the appetizer was quite tasty and hit the spot.\\\\n\\\\nMy friend ordered hot tea, which seemed to come in a magical pot.  The pot was only about two inches tall, and about as round as a very small tortilla, but it filled both of our normal sized cups three times.  It was a beautiful little creation of a pot, I must say. It looked like cast iron, and was very ornamental, and came with its own matching trivet to rest upon.  The tea was a very flavorful jasmine. How six cups managed to fit in that tiny pot is amazing.\\\\n\\\\nFor the entrees, I cannot remember the names of the dishes, nor can I find them listed online. Lemon Grass doesn't seem to have its own website, and all of the menu sites only appear to have a minimalist lunch menu, or something outdated.\\\\n\\\\nMy friend ordered something with many vowels and consonants, that was a seafood-curry-vegetable mix on a bed of 'crispy rice noodles', and I ordered another dish with many vowels and consonants, that was a pork based curry and vegetable (but lower on the veggie count) also over a bed of crispy rice noodles.\\\\n\\\\nAfter the waitress took our order, she came back from the kitchen to inform my friend that the dish she'd ordered was out, so my friend opted for the same as I.\\\\n\\\\nThe dishes arrived.  There was a giant mound of crispy white rice noodles, and they were indeed 'crispy', with a decent sized spot of the actual meat and curry portion nestled against it, with a ginormous decorative flower made of beet (my plate) and carrot (her plate) on a landscaping of parsley.  We switched plates...beets make me gag.  Then the waitress asked if we wanted chopsticks, and well...not so functional for a blind woman, but I opted to use them.\\\\n\\\\nThe dish was unusual and quite delicious - but a CHORE to eat, with either a fork OR chop sticks.  The first bite I tried to take with the chop sticks literally thrust the end of a very rigid rice noodle right up my right nostril.  In my friend's case, even with a fork, rice noodles were flying.  But, all in all, it was quite delicious. It was pork, a curry gravy, some bean sprouts, and fried egg strips.  Honestly, except for the grrrrrr of trying to contain the crispy rice noodles to the plate, it was a tasty and filling meal.  Quite pleasant, and it was nice to try something 'new' to us.\\\\n\\\\nThe bill wasn't outrageous, just under $40 for two entrees, an appetizer, and a pot of tea.\\\\n\\\\nWe both agreed that we'd go back...but next time we'll avoid the 'crispy' noodles for something a bit more malleable like rice or soft noodles.\\\\n\\\\nThe staff was fine and helpful - the food decent.  Heck the only thing that made the evening even slightly unpleasant was the cackling yinzer at one table who apparently thought she was in her own dining room at home.\\\\n\\\\nFor the pre-theater or concert scenario, I do recommend it.

We made a reservation for seven of us, but there was no need to call ahead - the place was empty except for a man sitting at the bar, and a couple of girls at another table across the room.  Definitely not hoppin\\'.  The color of the walls and the decor remind me of a hotel restaurant that only serves a breakfast buffet.  It\\'s very quiet in there, except for the low noises from a TV showing a football game in the next room.\\\\n\\\\nOur server was definitely \\\\\"set in her ways,\\\\\" as one of my coworkers said.  She had a routine in terms of when she took drink orders, when she took food orders, when she brought the check.  Deviations in the schedule seemed to cause a \\\\\"does not compute\\\\\" response across her face....like when I sat down and she asked what I wanted to drink.  I said I was going to wait until my next coworker arrived (thinking she might want to share some wine with me), and she was just like \\\\\"...you want to wait?  to order something to drink...?\\\\\" and I was all \\\\\"yes, I just got here....I don\\'t even know what I want!\\\\\" and she looked so confused, like how could some idiot like me possibly not know what they wanted to drink - finally she was like \\\\\"oh, do you need a list or something?\\\\\"  I know, I\\'m one of those difficult customers who requires a wine list in order to determine what wine I plan to order.  I\\'m weird like that.  Trying to order food at the same time as drinks was also a no-go.  You have to play by her rules.  When we did figure out the complicated drink-ordering situation, my coworker and I enjoyed our half-carafe of chardonnay.  I\\'d recommend getting a half carafe - the wine glasses are so small, paying $6 for a glass is a total rip off.  Get a half or full carafe and get your money\\'s worth.\\\\n\\\\nThe entrees come with soup and salad, which seems really old-school and kind of awesome to me.  They had one kind of soup, so you get what you get.  It was a chicken-vegetable-tortellini soup served in a little cup.  I liked it, because I like thin, brothy soups, but it wasn\\'t anything special.  The four little tortellinis floating around were the best part, and it was nice to have some veggies too.  Salad was standard iceberg lettuce, carrot shreds, some tinny-tasting black olives, and the acidic but not-bad strawberry vinaigrette that came on the side.  I didn\\'t bother with the bread - it didn\\'t look like anything special and it just came with butter packets.\\\\n\\\\nI got the pasta roll for my entree.  Despite having lots of ingredients (pasta, spinach, prosciutto, pine nuts, sambuca, tomato cream sauce, probably some cheese somewhere), the dish was surprisingly one note.  I didn\\'t think it was well-seasoned - I ended up pouring red pepper flakes on top to give it a zing, which didn\\'t help terribly.  The texture was good, and it was a cool idea, and it wasn\\'t a BAD dish, but it was just...meh.  Nothing exciting.  Very average.  Pretty bland.  I tasted a few other people\\'s dishes and my response was the same.  It\\'s just generic stuff.  Like I said, Olive Garden, only local.

And to top it off, they were dry as the sahara and served with NOTHING. \\\\n\\\\nI got the sliders at Harris about six months ago and there were four sliders to an order, and they were served on a fanciful, long plate with a selection of condiments - you know, ketchup, tomato, onion, mustard, etc. Normal things that people put on burgers every day.

Generally, I think monopolies are very bad, and this goes double for grocers because they know their customers are held hostage and can thus attempt whatever fuckery they\\'d like. Over the past decade, most other Giant Eagle locations in Pittsburgh\\'s East End were shuttered, meaning that the Negley/Centre store serves everyone. \\\\n\\\\nPerhaps my biggest gripe with \\\\\"Market District\\\\\" is that our bills at this Giant Eagle were consistently 15-18% higher than our bills at any other grocery store, in any city I\\'ve shopped in - and that\\'s WITH the coupons and Advantage Card \\\\\"discount\\\\\" added on. I guess in the end, calling something a Market District Giant Eagle is a clever way of telling customers \\\\\"We stock all the same crap you\\'d find at a regular store, but now we can charge you even MORE for pretending it\\'s premium, organic, or has been blessed by Emeril Lagasse.\\\\\" You also need to know that over-crowding is unavoidable at this store, unless you like to start your errands around 10 PM, and even then, it\\'s helpful to remember that customers exceed checkout lanes. Good thing we lived within walking distance of this location, because parking at this store is only marginally easier than driving a caravan of elephants through Manhattan at rush hour. \\\\n\\\\nThis store was never wanting for basic grocery staples when we shopped, but the \\\\\"Market District\\\\\" moniker somehow demanded that the aisles be set up to be as maximally non-sensical as possible. Do you want juice? Save your sanity, and don\\'t expect it to be near the other juices...you\\'ll want to look near the pasta, of course! To keep you on your toes, the store managers also randomly change the aisles at this Market District around a couple times a year. This is a common retail trick, intended to create \\\\\"excitement\\\\\" among customers, but really, all it does is make getting groceries as enticing as getting kicked in the balls. And who is stocking the produce at this place? Everything we bought would rot between 24-48 hours after we brought it home, and the peppers and tomatoes regularly looked like Mickey Rourke\\'s face after his plastic surgery disasters.\\\\n\\\\nMy last visit to this Market District store left me with an exceedingly sour taste in my mouth, thanks to some shady hijinks at the pharmacy. We picked up my husband\\'s script for a Schedule II medication, and soon after, discovered to our mutual horror that the pharmacy had shorted us 12 pills. 1 or 2, maybe 3 - that\\'s an innocent mistake. A 12 pill shortage on a 30-pill prescription means someone chose a career in pharmacy to feed an addiction or run a little hustle on the side, and it means my husband will be going without. We asked the manager, \\\\\"Dude, what the fuck,\\\\\" and the response we got was, \\\\\"We didn\\'t do nuthin\\'!\\\\\" Two weeks later, they had the nerve to Robo-Call my husband asking if he was interested in some \\\\\"valuable grocery coupons.\\\\\" Nice attempt at a save there Bub, but next time, don\\'t snatch our money and we won\\'t need those \\\\\"valuable\\\\\" coupons after all. (Isn\\'t it also fascinating that we\\'ve been shorted on scheduled meds at other pharmacies before, but no one pockets our migraine meds, antibiotics, or other items you can\\'t sell to teenagers in an alley?)\\\\n\\\\nTwo stars because the check-out staff is nice and the pasta/kosher deli selections rock. Otherwise, it\\'s a grocery store, and a below-average one at that.',\n",

I\\'ve already admitted it\\'s nothing special.  I know you\\'ve been there...we kept thinking what if we leave now just when he\\'s about to call.  So, we continue to wait and then someone walks in right behind us bumps Annie out of the way and just stands for maybe 30 seconds...the owner runs over bursts through Annie and I and just grabs the couple and seats them immediately.  I have never seen such blatent disregard for other customers\\'.  It was clear these folks were just regulars so he seated them ahead of everyone...what\\'s so bad is it was right in front of us.  I can appreciate that we are not regulars\\' , but c\\'mon pops\\' have a little discretion.  Please take this as a cautionary tale, doesn\\'t matter if you have a reservation, doesn\\'t matter if you leave your cell (btw, still hasn\\'t rang) and you pretty much don\\'t matter if you\\'re not a regular\\'.

My girlfriend and I tried to sit in the back but there was something going on there and so we eventually settled into one of the booths.\\\\n\\\\nThe bar seemed quite full for a Tuesday evening and our waitress (the bartender) told us that she would get to us shortly after we had seated ourselves.  After only a short wait, she was at our table taking our drink order.  I was actually impressed with how efficient she was by herself with the large crowd.  For dinner I decided to order the famous fish sandwich and a plate of pierogies (3) while my girlfriend went with the buffalo chicken wrap.  Our food came out within a reasonable time period and looked good with both of our sandwiches served with cole slaw.  The pierogies were absolutely enormous, almost as long as my hand and fried slightly, topped with onions and came with a side of applesauce.  Our waitress had asked us if we had wanted sour cream with them to but we politely declined.  They tasted pretty good as the slight fry gave them a crunchy exterior while the interior was soft and tasty.  By the time we were done with them, we had also eaten all of the applesauce as it made a good dipping sauce and helped keep the pierogies moist.  My sandwich was also pretty good as the breading on it was fried nicely and tasted good while the fish was mild.  I topped it with hot sauce and like a true Pittsburgher even put my cole slaw on it which helped to make it taste better. My girlfriend told me that she enjoyed her buffalo chicken wrap and the single bite that I took gave me a nice buffalo flavor.\\\\n\\\\nThe bottom line for me is that I am glad that I came here and might be back again depending on what I am looking for.  The food was dirt cheap with our whole bill coming to $22 and it exceeded the expectations that I had given to it whenever we walked in.  However, with that being said, the building is fairly run down and it is bar food and so I wouldn\\'t expect it to be the greatest food you have ever tasted.',\n",

When I got to the review page for this Radisson, it hit me....... \\\\\"Been there, done that.\\\\\"\\\\n\\\\nShort opinion here. Being a native SoCal person, I benefit from a great choice of hotels, throughout the Western states. So for years, when I\\'ve had to go back East, I prepare myself for older properties, musty rooms, and usually....... older bathroom fixtures, accompanied by really aged tile grout! If any of the above rings a bell...... you won\\'t be disappointed.\\\\n\\\\nIt\\'s really not that bad, but we West coasters are a bit spoiled. They do have a decent bar-restaurant. But as others have mentioned, this property exists on multiple levels. For instance...... the parking lot in the back? You get off the elevator on the 5th floor. If you\\'re going to the bar, THEN you hit \\\\\"Lobby\\\\\" and end up at the bottom of the hillside, which is still elevated above the access road. Sounds a bit convuluted, but it\\'s not that bad.

And your tour guide gives a history lesson on the house and plantation, as well as shares some ghost stories that either they/coworkers have experienced.\\\\n\\\\nIf you come at night, it can be a little scary getting here. Once you turn off the main street, you\\'re driving down a dark road with nature on both sides of you. Since we were already in a spooky spirit, it kind of felt like we were in a horror movie, hehe. Once you arrive at the plantation though, you just park and walk into their little gift shop. After everyone arrives, you watch a little video about the history of the place, including paranormal history. After that, your tour starts.\\\\n\\\\nYou walk over to the house, and tour the house, from downstairs to upstairs. Then, you walk outside to the outdoor kitchen, and then to a workmen\\'s shed. Then you walk past an old log cabin, and then get led back to the main gift shop. \\\\n\\\\nThe tour guide we had a was a very informative old lady. She told us a lot of history, and I learned new things. At one point of the tour, I did get a little lightheaded, and felt a little weird, and it was near an area where the tour guide said that she also has had weird feelings. What\\'s even weirder is that on our back home, my dad was telling me that he got lightheaded in a certain area, and when I asked him where, it was the same place I had gotten the same feeling! It was kinda spooky finding that out, but then kind of cool.\\\\n\\\\nThe tour was about ~$10 and I think it was worth it. I got a little spook, and learned a good history lesson. And I visited a historic plantation.\\\\n\\\\nIf you\\'re visiting the area, and are looking for something interesting and different to do, I suggest coming here. No matter what time of year.

We had scheduled a team-building group event at the US National White Water Center and so I searched for hotels around that area. When I saw this hotel featured as an airport hotel I figured it would be in a safe enough location with some close-by eateries and quick highway access, etc...\\\\n\\\\nWe booked a total of 13 rooms with them and checked in individually. I had been in contact with one of their hotel managers. I was a little dissatisfied in how poorly I welcomed to the hotel. \\\\n\\\\nThe front desk clerk seemed \\\\\"oh-so enthused\\\\\" to be working that night, and when I let her know that I had been in contact with the manager and just wanted to make sure everything was in good standing, she went in the back, he was there, and never even came out to greet me.\\\\n\\\\nNow I didn\\'t expect any VIP treatment. But usually when you organize a group event at a hotel you are give a very warm welcome. I know this because this wasn\\'t a first for me.\\\\n\\\\nI had requested a room with a crib (only two months in advance, with a reminder the day prior), and when I requested one that night, yes the same clerk, took over an hour to get it. At first I wasn\\'t even sure if she was going to because she never did give any indication she was paying attention to me at all.\\\\n\\\\nThe cable and internet did not work our first night there. No apologies were issued.\\\\n\\\\nThe room had a musty smell to it. I have a family of five (2 adults, 2 kids, and one baby) but they only had 3 towel sets in the room...even the next day after housekeeping came.\\\\n\\\\nThe hotel was not in the best of locations, it was secluded and not close to anything, and price-wise you could find better closer to downtown. I am not from Charlotte, NC and had only been there once...and again I figured \\\\\"airport\\\\\".\\\\n\\\\nThe hotel interior was nice and they did have a complimentary hot breakfast from served until 0930 am (another fact of information I had to PRY out of the front desk clerk). \\\\n\\\\nThe staff working the morning shift were much more pleasant and inviting. \\\\n\\\\nThe hotel was very quiet at night which we appreciated. The doors did not slam, thank God, as our baby girl is a very light sleeper. The hotel itself is clean and kept nice. It was not superior by any means but very nice for the average express.\\\\n\\\\nI rated poor because of the customer service but overall I would give it a three (average). However, I would not book here again not mainly due to my experience but due to the location. There are better hotels averaging the same distance from the USNWC but in better areas.\\\\n\\\\nIf anyone from management every reads this, please take a look into \\\\\"Deborah\\\\\" the front desk jerk...I mean clerk.\\\\n\\\\nStayed July 2011, traveled on business',\n",

You heard me, landed in Charlotte and after checking into my hotel, I decided to B-Line it to Mert's; because there was a need in me to have some good food, and I got delicious food.  \\\\n\\\\nFirst let me comment on the service... it was genuinely amazing.  I was promptly seated, and the hospitality was refreshing.  The server helped me patiently figure out what was good, and we settled on Southern Fried Chicken, Collard Greens and Mac & Cheese.  The Cornbread came out first, and it was mildly sweet, and tasty. \\\\n\\\\nLet's break down the meal.\\\\n\\\\nFried Chicken:  From the moment I took my first bite of the chicken breast, it was perfect cooked, juicy and hot, the meat was lightly battered, and the batter that was on it, was seasoned well.  It was a one of the better pieces of friend chicken I have had, not dry at all.   I would eat this every day, if I lived here, and I didn't have to worry about eating fried foods.  Recommendation, eat it, yum. \\\\n\\\\nCollard Greens:  I've had collard greens before, and this was good as most.  Admittedly, never had it with tomato before, but it was still delicious.  I liked the flavor, and the greens were tender, soft but with a nice bite.  The portion of the side was right, and complemented the chicken right.\\\\n\\\\nMac and Cheese: Yes Sir, this stuff was creamy, delicious, sauce done with tons of cheese flavor.  It was cooked right, because you don't see any sauce/oil separation.  In fact, all you do is taste the various textures, from the small clumps of cheese, to the noodles which are just cooked past al dente, but not much after.  It's like creamy goodness, yummy heaven, sometimes, I think you can make Mac and Cheese just the entire meal. \\\\n\\\\nHere we go, I love good food... but like a good infomercial... THERE'S MORE!\\\\n\\\\nWhat in the world is a Sweet Potato Cake?  That's lovely stuff, I had some, and it's like a tasty and the cream cheese frosting was amazing.  I think they spiked it, crazy amazing, not overly sweet, the texture was nice, and it melts in the mouth.\\\\n\\\\nHere's the kicker; I ate all the food and this doesn't really happen much, but it was perfect portion.  I'm 6'1, about 225lbs, and I thought all this southern comfort food would leave me heavy; but nope, it was just the right amount, and all for 15 dollars, with a coke.  \\\\n\\\\nLike many other Yelpers, KICK ASS food.

There is also a full service restaurant and bar in the Lounge area of the Hotel.\\\\n\\\\nI will also give them a nod for their complimentary shuttle which will travel you anywhere in a three mile radius of the hotel. The dude driving the shuttle was very polite and curtious ... I\\'m guessing because he didn\\'t have to stay or work in the Hotel itself.\\\\n\\\\nUnfortunately, that\\'s where the good stuff ends.\\\\n\\\\nThe gym facilities are atrocious. 2 Treadmills, a recumbant bike, and an Elliptical machine with maybe 4 medicine balls littered around a room that measures 6 ft x 20ft, if that. A grotesque pool with a grimey bottom that on more than one occasion I considered drowning myself in to free myself from my mortal shackles and break free from this prison of a hotel.\\\\n\\\\nConcierge wasn\\'t helpful at all -- when I arrived at the front desk and asked if I could score a bottle of water to use the gym, because I didn\\'t feel like paying the $4.00 fee for drinking the Fiji water they had in my room, the guy at the front desk stuck up his nose and snootily informed me \\\\\"You can purchase water from the gift shop.\\\\\" Sorry buddy, at over $150 bucks per night, you can *give* me a water for the cost of... free. Also, what kind of idiot buys bottled water as a gift?\\\\n\\\\nThe in House internet is the slowest you will find. I\\'m a computer / IT guy myself and it is flagrantly apparent that this place throttles their bandwidth usage. Online Games of any type slow to a crawl, and streaming video sites such as Hulu or YouTube take forever and a day to load. This is the year 2010 -- we should have hover cars by now, but apparently its too much to ask for a sad excuse for a Hilton to manage their Internet Connection enough to let me watch the Keyboard Cat before dying of boredom.\\\\n\\\\nThe location is also horrible. Right next to the Nascar Hall of Fame ... and thats about it. Everywhere you\\'d want to go is located 1/2 mile or so into the city, so you have to take the shuttle to get anywhere. Without the shuttle, this place would be unstayable.\\\\n\\\\nAlright / Mediocre Rooms + Satisfactory Shuttle Service + Snooty Concierge + Horrible Gym Facilities + Atrocious Location = Don\\'t waste your time. I saw a park bench a few blocks away that I will be living under during my next stay in Charlotte.

On this occasion we went with another couple who have never been to the Melting Pot before. We were super excited because we always leave full and happy. \\\\n\\\\nWe made a reservation for 5 pm, on Saturday, the first weekend of restaurant week. It took 15 minutes to be seated, which is a bit out of character for them, but considering the day and the weekend, it was understandable. \\\\n\\\\nWe were seated In a booth upstairs with one burner, which is a mistake with two parties - if you are going with two couples request two burners, it will make your life so much easier. \\\\n\\\\nWe got the cheddar cheese fondue, the pacific meal, and we made our own chocolate, the dark chocolate swirled with peanut butter. The food itself was very good, but I think our waiter was new and did not know how to balance all of his tables. \\\\n\\\\nWe had to ask for more food several times. You can ask for more bread and apples for example until all of your cheese is gone and vegetables and dips during the dinner (meat) portion. We were getting enough of the main part of each course but only enough of the secondary parts like the vegetables and bread and such for half of our group. During the meat part we had to ask another Melting Pot employee for more vegetables and dip because we had given up on our waiter ever bring anything back...we had asked him 20 minutes prior. \\\\n\\\\nOur waiter also turned the burner on too high the entire time, and very rarely explained anything to us, including the dips and the batter during our meat course. I understand that we had been there before, but our friends hadn't. And they didn't get to hear all of the fun things to do with dips like fill the mushrooms with the green goddess, or that the plums sauce is good on the shrimp, or if you mix curry and plum it makes a delicious new sauce. \\\\n\\\\nI think the takeaways from this meal was to 1. Always get at least one burner per couple, 2. Make sure your burners are always on the appropriate heat setting because it will burn your food, and 3. If you are going during prime dining time during restaurant week be prepared to be patient.\\\\n\\\\n***Update. Not even an hour after this review the manager, Steven called me to go over my review and to chat in order to improve their business. I think this is awesome! Remember how I said we had asked another employee for more veggies and dips? It was him! He was amazing and had even tried to see if they had an extra two burner table at the beginning of the meal.

The \\\\\"naan\\\\\" flat bread is piping hot when it comes to your table.  The garlic naan is my favorite.  And the curries are always wonderful.  \\\\n\\\\nIf you haven\\'t tried Indian food, take your time getting used to the menu.   Generally the main dishes are chicken, lamb or vegetables, in a different kind of curry sauce.  If you go on a date you can order two or three plates and share.  The items toward the top of each list are simpler and less spicy.  The further down the menu you go, the more interesting and spicy the dishes get.  I recommend starting with \\\\\"medium\\\\\" and seeing if that\\'s too hot or if you\\'d actually like spicier.   If you ask for \\\\\"between mild and medium\\\\\" they can do that too.  I like to pick one meat dish and one vegetable dish, usually something with potatoes.  Dinner comes with basmati rice (long grain rice with a little saffron).\\\\n\\\\nSuper friendly service although not American style waitering.  There is generally a head waiter who is also the host.  They will seat you and take your order.  After that, other waiters will serve you in turn, one getting drinks and another serving food.  It can be a bit slow at times, so don\\'t go if you\\'re in a rush.  Give yourself at least an hour or two.

One guy spilled his beer all over everyone around him and they were bumping and pushing people.  Someone went to get the bouncer and he just came and told the guy to stop.  Obviously that didn't do anything so the problem continued.   This was all during my favorite song which really made me mad.  The bouncer ended up coming back and getting the guys.  Later, during another GREAT song, the guys came back and pushed in front of us.  Next thing you know the guy got in a fight with all the other people around him.  It was a huge brawl and it took a good long time for any bouncers to arrive.  I felt very unsafe this whole time and it was because of the lack of awareness and/or the lack of care that the bouncers had for the well being of the patrons.  Will probably not be going back and will definitely not recommend going to any of my friends.\",\n",

We were suppose to mingle around and interview the suspects, but it was tough to identify suspects because 1) many people were in costume, 2) they did introduce themselves but the mic was very quiet so it was extremely difficult to hear 3) There was very little room in between people and there was a big column blocking the main stage area.  \\\\n\\\\nUpon are arrival we had salads waiting for us. This was bagged iceberg shredded lettuce, a mealy tomato, and a cucumber. This was beyond uninspired but the dressing was tasty (though bottled most likely). Our group mostly ordered the prime rib and two had the blackened chicken pasta. I thought the prime rib was better than expected. It was a tad on the small/thin side but it was cooked right (I asked for rare) and it was served with a nice baked potato and some au jus. I tried the pasta which wasn't amazing, but it certainly wasn't bad. The dessert was a pineapple orange pound cake which I found to be an odd choice. I was expecting it to be a signature dessert so I thought it might be good. It wasn't. It was served with canned pineapple and was overwhelmingly sweet. Why not serve chocolate cake, cookies, mousse? Those are choices more people are likely to enjoy. \\\\n\\\\nThe service was friendly -if a bit frantic. I felt bad for the servers since there wasn't a ton of room in the first place and now they had to work around people during the inquisition phase when people were walking around. I had to ask a couple times for some horseradish but in general I never wanted too long for anything. My drinks remained full..though the water had a bit of a funny pipe taste. \\\\n\\\\nThe show was bad. Costumes were super cheesy and the storyline very confusing. There were a ton of characters- maybe giving each table a list might help, or even name tags. Some actors were better than others but oddly enough their audience appointed actors did the stand-out job. There was very little actual show time and most of the time consisted of us having to go around and interview actors...or audience members. Which sounds more fun than it is because you wanted to enjoy your dinner. They took some cute pictures in the beginning and tried to get us to buy them for $20- but I wish they spent the money on a better production or layout. \\\\n\\\\nWe had fun since we came as a group, but overall half of us (and several others in the audience) left early, as it was rather disorganized and seemed to drag on.

I thought about leaving his practice to find a provider who was a little more in line with my own beliefs, but never really got around to it.  I am glad I didn't, and now  I am here to eat humble pie.  In the time since then, not only have the cats done several thousand dollars worth of damage to themselves when they were playing outside, but Dr. Mac always cheerfully patched them up for me (even though he was right and I was wrong.)  In fairness, I should have changed my negative review months ago, and just forgot about it.  In the meantime, he has caught some difficult diagnoses and since he knows I am a nursing student, taken every opportunity to help me learn in the process. He has always been helpful and conservative in his treatment, and all this for a fair price.  As it happens, I am moving in few weeks and might need to find someone closer to the new digs, but this guy knows his stuff and my pets would have lost their lives (all nine of them) if it weren't for Dr. Mac.\",\n",

But if I were looking at changing cable/internet/phone providers I would want to know this. \\\\n\\\\nI have had Time Warner Cable, Charter, and AT&T UVerse. Easily, I was the least satisfied with TWC. I recently left Charter once UVerse came into our area since it has the best to offer as far as DVR, channels provided for price (including promotions such as HBO, Showtime, Big Ten Network, NFL, MLB networks, etc), and the $150 gift card for signing up. Charter is better for high def TV (AT&T you pay extra), faster Internet, and unlimited phone and fax line is free if needed. Although faster Internet that Charter advertises may be overkill, as Consumer Reports recently noted that 15mbps is the most that the average consumer needs, and I get 18mbps with UVerse, which is slower than Charter. \\\\n\\\\nAT&T UVerse has the worst customer service by far. Recently I have had about a month of contacting the company (via telephone and on-line chat) for problems with transferring my phone number from Charter to UVerse. Something as simple as this still has not happened. The telephone customer service agents cannot give me anything in writing (no email, letter, anything), and cannot contact Charter directly, or if they do, they ask that I call Charter (already have 3 times). AT&T Uverse customer service agents have horrible documentation of the previous communications with their customers. They also call and leave messages that are so mumbled I cannot understand them. They also promise to call back at certain times then never call back. \\\\n\\\\nI was also promised my first bill would be $128 + tax, and the first time activation fee of $49 would be waived. My first bill is about $168, and no one appears to be able to address this fee or find documentation of this quote (and as above, AT&T does not provide anything in writing).\\\\n\\\\nSo if AT&T UVerse offers you a deal that sounds too good to be true, likely it is.

I figured, it would be best to stay close to the airport so we didn\\'t have to deal with the rush hour traffic.

I\\'m not sure why she didn\\'t use TripAdvisor. Probably because I always tell her \\\\\"Google Knows everything\\\\\" lol. Anyway, we arrived and were greeted by a nice young lady and the place seemed fine. The lobby area was clean. We made our way to the room, which upon first glance seemed okay. The sitting area was a nice size and the kitchenette area was clean. However, as we made our way in, I noticed the musty odor that is mentioned in other reviews. I decided to look at some reviews and see if maybe we were the lucky recipient of a room that had not been renovated yet. After reading the reviews and comments from the manager, I figured this must be the case. No problem right? Sure, I called down to the front desk and said to the nice young lady \\\\\"I see in your reviews, the hotel is having some renovations done and it seems we have received one of the musty smelling rooms that hasn\\'t been addressed yet. Do you have a room that has been renovated, that we can be moved to?\\\\\" Her response was, \\\\\"we have been doing some renovations, however not to the rooms. I don\\'t have a nicer room that I can move you to. Sorry.\\\\\" Well, I said to my girlfriend, it\\'s just one night and I don\\'t feel like driving to another hotel.

Not the large cold shrimp with cocktail sauce or the small shrimp tossed into the omelets.

I don't mind that perhaps English wasn't his first language, but there are somethings that do matter.  Like getting your napkin halfway through the appetizers is a little strange.  We were needing some space on the table because me and buddies ordered a lot of food.  It took a really long time for the waiter to come by and clear the dishes  - since it was him who noted the crowded tabletop.

I couldn't help but notice some post here claiming that oysters are really good.  Frankly, I'm no oyster aficionado, but after comparing with other restaurant, it was pretty weak.  In comparison to other oyster bars in the area, they were much to liquid-y. That is, they just didn't have enough substance on the whole and also, the taste wasn't really like seawater, it was more salt water than anything. Fairly disappointed in the oysters. Second, the mussel pot had a pretty good broth, but the mussels were far too small and you could easily tell that they were old/frozen.  The mussels tended to be a bit grainy and fall apart in the mouth.  The sushi was definitely standard and didn't pop out at me at all. Admittedly, the sweet'n'sour calamari or something like that was pretty good, but that's the extent of it.\\\\n\\\\nThird, the ambiance made me feel tired.

I'm sure other reviewers have gone into great detail about their gigantic beer selection, so I'll keep it short.  While the idea is great, it falls a little short.  While the size of the menu is supposed to be its selling point, its just too big!!!  And it has a lot of filler.  I noticed one reviewer who said that this is the biggest beer selection in NC.  Well, maybe, but biggest is not necessarily best (innuendo unavoidable :)  It's hard to take a lot of pride in a beer bar that has a bunch of macros and second rate micros, but (if my eyes don't deceive me) not a single saison?  And barely any lambics to speak of.  Whatever, they still have some pretty good stuff, I'm just being picky, but it seems like with a little quality control their selection could go from good to great.\\\\n\\\\nThis one was a little tough to rate.  Part of me wants to give it a 2 (bacon), part a 3 (atmosphere), part a 4 (beer and food menu), and part a 5 (the idea).

There were 3 vegetarian /vegetable options, 3 chicken options and a couple of of other things like soup, potato wedges, and rice pudding that was extremely soupy. I am a vegetarian, so I was already limited in my choices.  At one point I went back to get some more rice and the rice was never refilled, so I was literally scrapping the bowl!  I mostly ate a dish with broccoli in a tomato sauce, which was by far my most favored item on the day\\'s buffet menu.  While I did have an enjoyable time with my roommate, my taste buds were not jumping for joy as I had previously imagined that they would.  I love Indian food, but my experience at Bombay Grille was although not horrible, was also not what I would envision as something to be repeated.\\\\n\\\\nNormally at buffets I can usually eat between 2-3 plates.

I even thought that possibly they put heavy cream in their food, but of course I am not in their kitchen, so that will go unknown.

Buffets usually have a great selection, so that a person can sample several different dishes- Bombay Grille failed here.\\\\n2. Indian buffets usually have at least one dish with paneer- Bombay Grille failed here.\\\\n3. Indian buffets are supposed to have several different curry dishes (mild, medium, spicy and different kinds of curry). There was only one curry chicken dish.- FAIL\\\\n4. Bombay Grille- FAILed to refill the rice.. there were only 4 people in there at any given time!!!!  I\\'d hate to see what the buffet would like after 20 minutes if it was packed or even half way full.\\\\n5. Where were the spices? It\\'s bad enough that there wasn\\'t any good curry or paneer, but I couldn\\'t taste any spices.  In my opinion, this is an Americanized Indian restaurant. I could not taste any pepper, cardamon, anise, cumin, cinnamon, cloves, saffron, tamarind or turmeric! -FAIL\\\\n7.

For example, I made a charge to Food Lion using my debit card and my pin number, which means that charge should come through on my account IMMEDIATELY.  Instead, it didn't come out for two days, on the same day as an automatic withdrawal for a student loan payment.  The financial geniuses at this corporate mega-money factory decided that since they waited for two days to take it out, now they would take the debits out from largest to smallest, with no regard for the date and/or method of payment used.

Very much at the pinnacle of decent restaurants located in the university vicinity of Charlotte, it has all the ingredients: the food is of upper-end quality, it\\'s modestly priced, and has a fresh atmosphere. HOWEVER, if you are looking for a place with a staff that can understand and replicate English well- this place is not for you. I\\'ve heard various people toss that comment around every now and then. It may just be my opinion, but it seems as though the best authentic, non-American eateries are those with misplaced English skills, or a complete lack thereof. \\\\n\\\\nNow I myself usually don\\'t deviate from an ace menu item once I\\'ve found it, and as such I\\'ve had the same \\\\\"Southwest Quesadilla\\\\\" from Zaps for the past 6 years. First thing I\\'ve ever ordered from \\'em. Think I care? Nah. Sure don\\'t. I have only recently been \\\\\"around the block\\\\\" with other various items on the menu and to no shock whatsoever, find them all exquisite as well.\\\\n\\\\nOverall, here are a few things to consider about the business: 1) Adequate spacial constraints with an up and downstairs, each consisting of its own outdoor section, 2) lakeside view, 3) great food/ menu combinations & a plethora of menu items from a very basic \\\\\"kids\\\\\" to a \\\\\"make-your-own\\\\\" spin off anything they have to offer really, 4) generous portion sizes, 5) full bar selection and quality margaritas, 6) drink specials for every day of the week, 7) VERY quick service (9 out of 10).

You come in at one end, look at a menu board of choices - mostly consisting of a variety of burrito choices - and place your order.

I think it may be less confusing to some if the menu boards were simplified to reflect this.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nAs to the food, it\\'s pretty decent.

First, I waited in line for 10 minutes to pick up the script- there was one person at the counter and two other people ahead of me.  When I finally got to the counter, the script wasn't ready even though it had been called in over an hour before I arrived (what's the hold-up?).  The Pharmacy Technician yelled for them to expedite it (great!) and told me to have a seat while they finished filling the script.  Ok.  I sat and listened... and listened... after 10 minutes I asked another Pharm Tech approximately how long it would be until my script was ready.  He looked and told me it was ready.  I asked why nobody had called me and he said he didn't know.  I got back in line again to check out... this time there were five people ahead of me.  After waiting another 15 minutes there's finally only one person ahead of me... the lady at the counter has a cart load of items and the Pharm Tech asks if she'd like to pay for her items there.  I can't say I blame the customer- if I had other items, I wouldn't want to wait in another line, but seriously, there's quite a line of people who can't check out up front at the general registers- let's serve the people to need to use the pharmacy.  She checks out and then proceeds to question the price of baby-wipes (buy one get one half off that didn't ring out as such).  So now the only person checking people out at the Pharmacy is doing a price check for baby-wipes while the rest of us continue to wait.  Finally, a second Tech arrives and takes the woman in front of me and then takes me.  I explain to him my frustrations as it has taken me over 30 minutes to pick up my script and that NOBODY called me when the script was ready.  The Pharmacy Manager tells me that she did call me and I didn't hear her.  I told her I was sitting in the chairs and nobody called her.  She proceeds to say she speaks fast and I probably didn't understand her.  I'm from New York- we don't know how to speak anything except fast- don't insult me!  I continued to explain my frustrations- having to wait in line twice, nobody telling me the script was ready, etc.  She asked how she could address the situation but at that point there was nothing they could do- I had already spent nearly 40 minutes picking up a script that the doctor had called in over an hour before I even arrived.  At this point, I just wanted to get out.  As I left, another customer told me how rude  I was and that I needed to be more patient!  Haha!  Mind your own business- I don't have time to spend 40 minutes picking up a prescription!  When I got home, I was told that CVS has called to say the script was ready- yup, even though I was sitting less than five feet from the counter, they called HOME rather than me!  This pharmacy needs a lesson in customer service and efficiency because both were seriously awful.  I mentioned that I am new to the area- I recently relocated from Chicago and always used CVS there.  My doctor would call in a script and within 10 minutes, the CVS would have it filled (the time it would take me to walk the 2 blocks from my doctor's office to the CVS).  The couple times the CVS was backlogged, they'd have me take a seat but as soon as the prescription was ready, they'd call me up and check me out immediately- I NEVER had to wait in line TWICE!!!  I always had such wonderful experiences at the CVS in Chicago but will definitely not be using this CVS again.  There are several Walgreens and Rite Aids in the area- I'll be using them from now on.\",\n",

This place\\'s was a bit watered down.\\\\n\\\\nThe steak and potato arrived after we finished the salads. My friend enjoyed his, and I thought mine was fine. It was a bit tough and chewy, but not enough to send back. I finished it all and was fairly satisfied and definitely full.\\\\n\\\\nEveryone has their preferences, and for about the same price, I prefer Texas Roadhouse. They are more tender and juicy in my opinion, as well as thicker and more marbled. I like their tea much better (less bitter and more sweet) and their side salads (dressing there is thicker with less iceberg lettuce). They serve rolls instead of sliced bread, which i also prefer. So, I guess maybe is all down to preference, and I prefer Texas Roadhouse.\\\\n\\\\nAs for the service, that was a-okay. No problems there, minus the urge to up-sell, which I find quite annoying, but I accept it is a part of eating out. Our server was quick on the refills and checked in to make sure the meals was (as she put it), \\\\\"okay.\\\\\"\\\\n\\\\nAs the star rating and the server said, it was all \\\\\"okay.\\\\\" Not a place I would return to unless it was someone else\\'s idea and they had the desire for it.

Deal with it kids, this is that slice of Midwest Americana you've been looking for in any number of wayside eateries in rural America.  Fish fry anyone?\\\\n\\\\nTo begin, let me explain that one of the many draws for the Beach House's patrons is the fact that it is still legal to smoke indoors in McFarland.  I stepped inside and was immediately made aware of this fact as plumes of smoke took up residence in my clothes and nose.  \\\\n\\\\nDo not fear, however, there is a separate dining room that is nonsmoking.

Packed with waitresses who wore skin tight white Jordache jeans, giving you a fleeting sense of their giving nature.  Packed with the eager anticipation of an entire day spent watching football and football-related activities: drooling, eating, drinking, and smoking.  God bless America.\\\\n\\\\nThe AM dish to get here is the Walleye and eggs breakfast.  I would tend to agree, although their limited selection of omelets is made marginally more tasty by the addition of broccoli (you heard me punk).

The calendar of events is not conspicuous, so on the day of the event, all the conference attended entered the facility through the conference center doors and wandered about searching for the Monona Room.\\\\n\\\\nLike most conference facility, the food was a mixed bag.\\\\n\\\\nThings I liked:\\\\n* I enjoyed the caesar salad served with lunch with fresh greens (no iceberg lettuce), tangy dressing and herbed croutons that did not go overboard with the salt or garlic.\\\\n\\\\n* Other than the overcooked noodles, the penne pasta with mushroom, spinach, goat cheese, pine nuts and roasted red pepper cream was a well-executed dish.\\\\n\\\\n* While the filling had a bit too much citrus flavor, kudos to the kitchen staff for serving us a cannoli with a crunchy shell, a rarity on the conference food circuit.\\\\n\\\\nThings I didn't:\\\\n* The rigatoni with fennel sausage, roasted peppers and arriabiatta sauce lacked the finesse of the aforementioned penne pasta dish.  With its mushy noodles, overcooked sauce and under-seasoned sausage, there was little to like.\\\\n\\\\n* If you enjoy a heavy does of garlic powder on bread with the texture of a teething biscuit, you would love the garlic bread served with the pasta course.\\\\n\\\\n* My least favorite dish was toasted cheese sandwich served during the planning session the day before the conference.  For $14.95, I expected aged cheddar served on gently grilled slices of artisan sourdough bread.  What I received was very different.  Served barely warm, the bread was soaked in butter and toasted to a brick-like texture that left cuts on the roof of my mouth.  The institutional grade cheddar and provolone cheese had started to congeal by the time the staff served it to me.  The server did not check in with us because she didn't want to interfere with our meeting, preventing me from sending this dish back for a replacement.  The roasted tomato soup, though cool, was the redeeming feature of my meal.\\\\n\\\\nOverall, the experience with the Marriott Madison West was A-OK, based on the positive interactions with the staff, which offset the spotty food quality.\",\n",

Total hole in the wall on East Wash in a strip mall behind some Mexican buffet, with the name People's Bakery, you'd never guess this place would have the best Middle Eastern food in Madison.  \\\\n\\\\nStart with the wife of the wife and husband team, who greets you warmly as you come in.  The menu is on the wall, but there are hard copies for those who need an explanation of the nicely blended mix of Lebanese, Armenian and Syrian dishes.  No matter your experience with food of the Middle East or Mediterranean, you'll find dishes you recognize, perhaps by different names.\\\\n\\\\nThis was my first visit, I'm sitting here eating my takeout order as I type this because it's that good.  I ordered the lentil soup, and several appetizer portions including hummus, moohamara, sarma, and falafel.    \\\\n\\\\nQuick review:\\\\n- lentil soup.  Awesome, just awesome.  Beautiful saffron color from the cooked down red lentils, just the right mix of cumin and lemon, and a back end of heat, I'm guessing from Aleppo pepper.  This is some thick soup, and filling, and for 2.50, you get a pint\\\\n\\\\n- Moohamara.  I wasn't going to get this.  I like roasted red bell pepper, and I've had dips and purees made of them, but I've never sought it out.  Mary, one of the owners, told me it was her favorite, best on the menu.  And holy COW was she right.  A smack of roasted red pepper is quickly deepened by a sweet hit of pomegranate and walnuts, ubelievably complex and wonderful.\\\\n\\\\n- Falafel.  Huge portion, perfectly deep-fried, with a really nice, light texture.  Love the falafel, but I prefer tahini sauce, and these come with a yogurt mint sauce.  Don't get me wrong, this is clearly their regional interpretation, Im all about the authentic experience, and this was good sauce.  But, I confess that for my leftovers I'm making some tahini sauce.\\\\n\\\\n- Hummus.  You know, hummus is always a crap shoot for me.  I make my own, from dried chick peas, and I've been working on this recipe for 25 years (along with my Bloody Mary recipe and about a hundred others). This is another of those regional interpretation issues, this was my least favorite today.  I'll try it again, because my own hummus has on and off days.  This was just more on the bland side than I expected,  No one distinct flavor dominated so I felt like it was left with an almost indescribable flavor.  Not bad, totally edible, just oddly unflavored.  I added some lemon and salt, which helped some.  \\\\n\\\\nSarma - if you're expecting dolmathes this will be familiar in flavor, but it texture.  These are served cold with a yogurt dipping sauce.  I'm okay with the temperature, but I just like a little lemon on mine.  These are veg, the rice filling is cooked down to a coarse 'risotto-y' consistency.  I dig them, but those who prefer the snap of dolmathes will find these softer, but just as flavorful\\\\n\\\\nAll in all, outstanding.  Next time, shish tahouk and baba ganouj.\",\n",

Although I never felt like the service was great there, the prices were good and they seemed to care about the dogs, so I kept coming back. \\\\n\\\\nI don't know if something changed, but over time my dog started coming back sore and covered in blood.

I asked the owner about this, and she said that nothing was going on and that he played well with other dogs. \\\\n\\\\nWell two months ago, my healthy four year old dog came back barely able to walk. It took weeks before he recovered, and he still hasn't seemed himself. I can't help but wonder what goes on there, but it seems like something fishy is going on. \\\\n\\\\nTo make matters worse, I boarded him at a different kennel last weekend. The owner immediately called me after I dropped him off and explained that he was acting traumatized and terrified of the kennel. He said it was very obvious he was not suited for kennels. \\\\n\\\\nUnfortunately, he also told me that some kennels are known for taking dogs that don't do well and lying to the owners to keep the business. When I mentioned Hickory Hills, he laughed and said they were the worst kennel in Madison. He also told me a story about how the owner or manager killed several dogs by leaving insect poison out in the play area.\\\\n\\\\nI feel so lucky my dog wasn't more hurt at this horrible kennel, and I hope nobody else has to lose a beloved pet to this sub-par facility.

First and foremost the customer service here is terrible. My parents have visited the shelter on more than one occasion to view the dogs ready for adoption and have yet to be greeted with a friendly helping hand. If they had they would have a dog right now. Its hard to enquire about a dog when no one or information is available regarding the dog. In addition I believe adoption fees ranging from $175.00 to $350.00 are a bit much especially considering the funding the Dane County Humane Society receives.  Perhaps they should consider arranging discounted fees with vet services they use.  I understand it does cost a great deal of money to home an animal which should be taken into consideration by the adoptee however you shouldnt have to spend hundreds to get a dog. I mean considering they put thousands of dogs to sleep each year!!! Nonetheless if you can rescue a animal from here...There is no greater gift than the gift of life!',\n",

On one hand they have some unique academic programs and great professors, but you\\'ll probably have to slog through lots sub-par classes before you get the good classes. \\\\n\\\\nBusiness is one of the \\\\\"better\\\\\" colleges, but you wouldn\\'t know if from the lower level classes. My least favorite class ever was an upper level econ (econ is technically in LAS even though business people spend plenty of time in the department) class that was taught by a TA who not only didn\\'t speak very good English, but who also gave really harsh tests. The first test average was a 64% and there was no curve. Grading is harsh here! Lots of people repeat classes. I also have plenty of bad things to say about accounting and finance classes, but it depends on the class I guess. \\\\n\\\\nLAS is the catch-all college that gets shafted a lot. Many of my lectures were too big and in auditoriums were literally falling apart. Contrast that with the much-funded engineering college\\'s glittering shiny collection of brand new giant buildings. Oh well. \\\\n\\\\nACES, my college, is a bit of a catch-all college as well, but some of the majors are quite small. I\\'ve had my smallest and favorite classes in ACES. For development and other niche economics specialties this is the place to be and undergrads get lots of attention. It also has top-notch programs in other aggy stuff ranging from food science to animal science. I adore most of my professors I have had in this college. The only downside is that ACES has tended to attract some less than bright students in the past and has some programs within it in need of reform, but I\\'m sure that is true in many UIUC colleges.  I recommend ACES, but only if you are truly interested in the curricula. \\\\n\\\\nI would note that I skipped all gen-eds and a lot of ugly giant lower level classes thanks to APs and placements tests. If you can do that, it is worth it, because the upper level classes are where you can really enjoy academics. The lower level classes seem to be purposefully soul-crushing, with harsh curves, unintelligible TAs, and professors who just read off powerpoints. 101 classes are where learning goes to die. I basically did well on them by memorizing lectures off flashcards, a sad way to \\\\\"learn\\\\\" if you ask me. Don\\'t be afraid to switch classes if you get a bad feeling on the first day. I did that a lot and it was worth it for the English-speaking TAs. \\\\n\\\\nI am personally not a fan of the Greek system, which welds a little too much power here. The drunken anti-intellectual environment can be stifling if you don\\'t find a niche. Allen Hall is the place to be for anti-Greeks/hippies/outsiders and it has the bonus of small lower level classes often taught by people who actually care. Avoid the isolated residence halls like PAR and FAR, go six-pack only if you are Greek-ish, and ISR is the place to be for engineers and other assorted people who want to live near the science and engineering buildings. Dorm food is a mixed bag...it\\'s mostly just inexcusably bad, but most people don\\'t seem to notice because they think fries and hot dogs= acceptable lunch. \\\\n\\\\nI like the Chambana area, even if it has some minor annoyances. Ill-kept frat houses and a bizarre lack of on-campus grocery stores mar it, but otherwise it was easy for me to find restaurants to eat at and assorted drunk-free places to hang out. However, I can think of about ten major cities where I\\'d rather live.\\\\n\\\\nThe weather here is horrible.

The noodles also had a weird rubbery texture I've never experienced before. It was edible, but not good.  Perhaps I just didn't order it properly? \\\\nSo a friend was visiting and we both had a taste for thai food. Nitaya was on our way to downtown so I decided we could give this place another try.
