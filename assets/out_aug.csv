Had high expectations, especially considering the expensive price for a Vegas restaurant. I had the bone marrow ravioli which the waiter recommended. It had a funny taste to it and I didn't like it. Maybe it's an acquired taste? Moved on to my pasta. I ordered the black pasta, since the waiter said it is the same thing as squid ink pasta. I've had the authentic thing in Venice, Italy and this was definitely not it! For one it tasted like regular pasta. The one in Venice had a slightly briny seafood taste to it which made it unique compared to regular pasta, and B&B's did not. Also, I couldn't believe how salty and spicy the pasta was. Is squid ink pasta supposed to leave a burning sensation in your mouth? I don't think I'll be coming back here. I was just there yesterday to get more paint supplies... and actually gonna go back there today! My husband and I come here so much(at least once or twice a week), so much that some of the staff already know us because we come here so often haha. We always get the greetings \""Oh you're back! weren't you just here the other day?\"" or \""How's your house projects coming along?\""  We love the paint department here compared to the other home depot on craig. The 2 staff that work at the paint department always greet us with a smile and ask how our painting is coming along. We love all the staff there, they're always helpful and friendly, which it makes it so much easier on us, and whenever you have a question, theres always someone just right around the corner! :) We always go in there with the intentions of buying 1 thing, and ONLY 1 thing, and walk out with a cart full of stuff and spend a few hundred dollars rather than 10 bucks that we had originally intended on spending. Oh well! We love working on our house and making it ours :) Tiles is our next project! I feel like we're one of their best customers lol... do we get a reward for being such great customers and spending so much money there?? I think we deserve a reward! or coupons? anything!? haha I wish... but 5 stars, hands down. Its the great customer service that keeps us coming back for more. Keep it up! :)",2,concat

He tried to tell me this food wins awards every year somewhere...  I definitely did not get anything that would win awards.  Oh, and although I pointed out specific problems in technique, he blew my issues off as being just \""a matter of taste\"".  Mind you, I was the only asian in that establishment - kitchen, and otherwise.\n\nKorean tacos - there is NOTHING Korean about these tacos.  We don't use shredded meat for one, its way too salty and all I tasted that had a Korean link was Soy Sauce (maybe some brown sugar?).  Owner/manager guy said of course its Korean, it has Korean spices in it.  I don't think he knows anything about Korean cuisine....\n\nCalifornia rolls - how do you mess these up?  I guess by not putting anything but crabmeat and a tiny bit of cucumber that was poorly matchsticked.  These were so bland, I ended up putting some of the Korean taco meat filling on top and added some of the shell crumbled up for texture.\n\nEel/Dragon roll - the Dragon roll had one thick slice of avocado across 3 pieces of the roll.  The eel was over done in sauce that tasted almost burnt - its either not seasoned right or over caramelized.  Of course this same sauce is found on the Eel sushi.\n\nThe Peanut butter Jellyfish roll - this was actually not too bad.  Nothing to write home about, but not completely wrong like everything else.\n\nI put pretty much all the wasabi we received into about half the saucer of soy sauce and could barely taste it.  Is it fake?  The rolls were also sliced unevenly, which is a fine detail that you appreciate at good sushi restaurants.  They were also not rolled tightly enough, so everything fell apart pretty much as soon as you grabbed it.\n\nAll in all, never again. I cannot say enough good things about this bridal store. Evana (sp?) and the rest of the associates were incredible. I had a somewhat unique situation based on the fact that I have 2 mothers and I wanted both of them to have the experience of finding \""the wedding dress\"" with me. Evana and her girls made sure that both of them felt so special and wonderful that it brought tears to my eyes. My dress was perfect and they were so upfront and honest about alterations and what was needed. I changed up the look of my dress by removing the belt and placing a new bedazzled applique on the left hip that made it even more stunning than it already was. They walked me through this entire process and made sure I was 100% satisfied. They also made time for my many phone calls and search of hair accessories, shoes, etc. I would recommend them to anyone looking for a dress, and I promise you TRUST what they tell you! They all totally know what they are doing!!! Thank you so much for such an incredible experience with something so important. I love you all!!",2,concat

(Which is weird enough....that you can see opened very cans of soda and cut up lime and lemons that have been sitting out for who knows how long). Horrible service. Horrible attitude waiters. Would never go back. I am surprised that this chain has not been shut down. I absolutely loved my food here. It has been a long time since a restaurant really impressed me with their food, and khyber pass really is one of the gems in that list. I went in with really a complete blah mood, up for really anything. We were seated in the terrase. The servers were extremely fast, professional, and friendly. Their atmosphere is pretty good too. I honestly have no idea on Afghan culture let alone on their cuisine, so this was a great intro to their stuff. Like I said their food blew me away. I had the table d'hote, which consisted of lentil soup and lamb korma, with the rose water rice pudding. Loved the soup and the korma not so much of the dessert as I dont like rose water flavor in general. The korma was splendid and my husband's sabzi poolao (spinach one) looked and tasted great too. \n\nOh plus you can BYOW here and apparently they have a cave decor on the other side of the resto thats only open during Fri's and Sat's.\n\nAnyway I cant guarantee on the authencity of the cuisine itself, but it did give me good positive feel on it.

I was not sure what to expect, but at the prices for the burgers, I was expecting something good. Unfortunately, this restaurant failed to deliver.\n\nBefore I get to the food, I should point out a few things that really detracted from the dining experience. When I went into the restaurant, I noticed it was quite dark. After looking around the floor and seeing how dirty it was with the remains of food and even a spilled drink, I concluded that the lack of lighting is to hide how poorly the establishment is cleaned. There also seemed to be a lack of servers, and the wait time for everything was quite long. Finally, the air conditioning was either not working properly or was set high, as it felt very hot inside and I saw someone at the table in front of me using a makeshift fan.\n\nI ordered a burger using the make your own option. While the burger itself was not bad, the toppings were mediocre at best. I did not like how both the ketchup and mustard were very spicy, and the lettuce and tomato were not appetizing looking at all. \n\nFor the prices that were being charged, even with a coupon, the food should have been better. There is absolutely no excuse for the lack of cleanliness in the restaurant, and it was an uncomfortable experience waiting around a long time for the food. The overall experience was bad, and I will not be returning. I was there last week having them check my car battery. Corry was there helping me to check the battery. He was very helpful and  honest. He helped me changed the battery and declined to accept a tip saying that he was glad that he could help me, and that was part of  his job.",2,concat

Now that in itself doesn't completely turn me away, however I do expect top notch quality and service if I'm going to pay 144 dollars for a steak. This was far from the case. The waiter did not seem knowledgable in steaks aside from how to steer you away from the reasonably priced filet mignon. \n\nThe ribeye for two that me and my brother shared came out freezing cold and extremely undercooked. Not only that but the meat was chewy and some pieces were down right not edible. \""The best steak in Las Vegas\""? I think not!\n\nMy recommendation, go to Ruth's Chris in harrah's and get a 50 dollar steak that won't disappoint. Well... I've been here a few times and have to write a review.  This place is amazing.  Somehow it seems to get better every time I go.  First couple times I just had like a Hang Over Burger and it was darn good and a little unique with the chilis.  Then I had a BBQ Burger.  Hard competition because ya know, everyone has one on their menu, but I was impressed with their own BBQ and of course, the pretzel bun.  Then I tried the PB&J Burger on a whim.  OMG.  Fricken Amazing.  I mean like amazing enough that I will crave it and have to go for it.  All their sides and tots are great and then I tried the Jamaican corn.  Also amazing and totally unique.  So good I went again last night and totally went PB&J w/ corn.  I had to go back though because I was in NYC and someone who travels to Scottsdale says, oh have you heard of Rehab...  YEAH I HAVE.  Tells me to try the Medium/Gold chicken wings.  So that happened.  Cooked perfectly, sauce was spicy and mustardy and delicious.  Off the charts.  Someone else got the pig wings where were also great.  I'm thinking they ought to put that medium/gold sauce on some pig wings or pulled pork too, it would be great.  At this point, it's going to be hard for me to be in the area and go somewhere else.

It was disappointing to the point of being comical. My wife summed it up perfectly when she said, \""If a contestant on Top Chef had put this food in front of him, Collichio would have torn him a new one.\""\n\nI ordered the New York strip. Good, but nothing special. I actually thought the New York strip I had at Elway's at the Denver airport was better. I also got the fries, because I love a good steak-frites. The plate of fries I got looked like a plate you'd get at Denny's. Very dry, over salty, with no flavor. I sent them back, which is the first time I've ever sent food back at a restaurant, but for $13 a plate, those fries should have tickled my gonads. I even asked them if the fries were frozen. They assured me they make them by hand daily. I guess I'll take them on their word, but I have my doubts. So for $75 I got a decent steak and terrible fries. Oh yeah, and the cheapeast glass of red was 17 bucks. Again, good but nothing special. The next tier up was in the high 20s and mid 30s. That's asking a heck of a lot for a glass of wine.\n\nMy wife ordered the brisket which was good. However, the mustard dressing on the brisket was the same sauce they put on the vegetables, so everything on her plate tasted the same. My wife is also gluten and dairy free and asked if she could substitute the creamy polenta that came with the brisket for something else. The waitress said she would check, but we never saw her again until they brought our food with the creamy polenta. Then it got funny. To the manager's credit she didn't charge us for the fries and comped us two free desserts. Three different people assured my wife that she was getting dairy-free sorbet including the manager. One of the flavors was fromage-blanc which tasted great. I asked the manager how they got such an authentic cheese flavor without using dairy. She actually got the dessert chef who explained that they used goat cheese. We all paused for an awkward silence. My wife was too embarassed to say anything and I was on the verge of cracking up. Finally the chef asked if my wife was okay with goat cheese. My wife allowed the chef to save face and said yes, but when she left we lost it. Memo to Tom Collichio and his staff: CHEESE IS DAIRY! Even if it comes from a goat. \n\nI will say the desserts were excellent and by far the best part of the meal. But if you go to a steak house and the best thing is dessert, it's not a good steak house. I'm sure this place will be successful simply because it's Tom Collichio, but if it was anyone else's name on the door people would say it's so-so and ridiculously over priced.

Happily, BNYCP has a roll of paper towels on each table-when they bother to put a fresh roll out. We waited For. Ev. Er. to order. We were finally able to order our 8 slices-we couldn't decide whether to get whole pies or not, and reading some of the reviews, I'm glad we didn't. They put two slices on one \""plate,\"" so not everyone got a plate. \n\nThe pizza itself was not that great. There was lots of sticky, sweet sauce soaking through the crust and dripping off the large and flimsy slices. I'm glad to see someone was able to get a fork-we tried, but we were told we could only get a fork if we ordered a salad. Nice touch! Meanwhile, sauce is dripping off the pizza to land on my shirt or the table. \n\nMy husband and I chose ham and pineapple slices. I don't know what kind of \""ham\"" this was, but it was actually soggy, with a texture like cheap, generic bologna. Terribly gross. They were also very skimpy with the cheese, so I'm not really sure how that tasted.\n\nAs we were finishing up, a man came in carrying a toddler and asked if he could use the restroom. Apparently they said no, because he threw a fit, and told the manager (or whoever he was) that it was pretty bad they wouldn't let a little girl use the restroom. \n\nVery slow service, not terribly clean, not terribly well-stocked, bad pizza, and no forks or restrooms. I think I'll pass! I came to the Wynn for the first time a couple years back, just after they opened. Haven't stayed anywhere else since (and I go to Vegas every couple of months).\n\nGambling:\nOthers have commented on the high minimum tables, and they're right -- the $25 minimums mostly turn into $50 by 9 or 10pm on a weekend, and are kind of like citronella for the hordes that swarm around cheap tables in otherwise nice hotels like the Venetian. On top of the thinner crowds, the dealers here are the best on the strip. I've gotten to know a few and highly recommend Joy at the $50 blackjack tables (usually on the noon-8 shift). She's a bundle of, well, joy, and energy and is always a delight to play with. She'll get the table talking and joking, and really makes it a nice experience regardless of whether you're winning or losing.\n\nI've been playing more poker lately, and the poker room at the Wynn, while small, is comfortable and full of action. Not off the hook Commerce Casino action, but the $500 no limit frequently sees $1000 pots and there are always good players as well as rich tourists abounding. I'm an okay player, and I've discovered that the game for me is about whether I can gobble up the rich tourist dollars faster than the pros can take me down. I've had a couple of great nights as well as one god awful weekend here, but it's always been fun! \n\nRooms:\nThe rooms are superb. I don't think the walls are any thinner than other high end hotels on the strip and have never overheard conversations, etc. I read a review talking about the noise from the club and am astonished -- I've stayed on low floors, high floors, and suites, and have NEVER noticed club noise or strip noise. It's a hotel, not a sanatorium, so there's some audible presence of others, but if that keeps you awake at night you've got issues. I've stayed during working trips also, and found the rooms to be really conducive to work: fast internet, speedy room service, and space to lay out books and papers while you work.\n\nFood:\nMy favorite restaurant in Vegas is the Daniel Boulud brasserie at the Wynn. It's pricey, but the value you get makes it feel like a steal! Don't miss the charcuterie appetizer, and I highly recommend the steak dinner. The sommeliers are superb and have never tried to upsell me past my price-point -- in fact, I was once going to splurge and told him I was interested in a great wine and would spend $300-$400; he came back with a $250 recommendation! \n\nThe other restaurants are all pretty stellar. Bartolotta is fantastic -- they fly in their fish from the Mediterranean daily and when you order a whole fish it's filleted for you tableside which is such fun to watch. Corsa is solid Italian food (they once made an off-menu pesto preparation for me, which is odd at high-traffic restaurants but spoke volumes about their customer service). The country club has what is possibly the best lobster preparation in the country (steamed and served with drawn tarragon butter that makes me drool to think about). Okada is a little oasis of sushi with fanciful preparations and the softest toro I've had since Hamano Sushi in San Francisco. SW has never once overcooked my steak and gets the exact temperature and color on a 3-inch thick filet which is not easy. My only hold out is Wing Lei. Maybe I've just never had the right thing, but most of the food there tastes like regular Chinese food, except much more expensive. \n\nCustomer Service\nI benefit from having a Casino Host (Pucci -- World's Best Host!) who arranges my stays. But the fact that I have a host at all once again speaks volumes about Customer Service at the Wynn, since I'm nowhere near a high roller. Sure, I'll play the $100 black jack tables, but as others have pointed out that's nothing at this place. On a weekend night, there are banks of tables that I can't even go near. Yet I've never once paid for a room and Pucci frequently finds a way to cover a good chunk of my (at time exorbitant) restaurant tabs.",2,concat

However, my experience has been that as the middle entity within landlord/tenant relations, Brady Realty group has demonstrated a consistent focus and priority towards paying attention to how they treat both parties and about their reputation. I like dealing with businesses where the owner is actively involved.\n\nI would encourage anyone seeking to do business with a dependable and reputable property management business in the Las Vegas area to put Brady Realty group on their short list to call and consider before making a decision.

You are a liar. \n\nIn an email from your establishment, you suggested that I take time out of my day to come to your establishment to explain to your waitstaff what the issues are. Multiple members of your waitstaff, including management ARE the issue. I explained this in an email to you. I've been treated rudely over the phone and in person multiple times. Your DM had previously stated that this was because of how much I used to frequent your establishment--that my large number of bad experiences were because I was a regular customer. That is just the most ridiculous thing I've ever heard! I get bad experiences because I spend my money and pay your wages more often than other people? Are you f@#$%^&* kidding me???!!!\n\nAgain, multiple times, in a row, you forgot items when I picked up orders to go. Your waitstaff was rude in person and over the phone.No one is checking orders. I used to manage restaurants and work every position in one. I would make drastic changes if I were you.\n\nIf I came to your establishment, ordered food, ate it, and did not pay for it--you would call the police and I would be charged for defrauding the establishment. \nIn this case, I paid you and you did not (on multiple occasions) give me the food that  I paid for. You also double charged my bf's card, and when we came in to eat breakfast with a gift certificate I asked the waitress what happened to any unused portion. She became very upset (I was very nice), rushed to get the manager, who very sternly told me there would be no cash back. Excuse me, I never asked for cash back, I asked if the left over would be issued on a new certificate. I don't want your handouts. You have me confused with \""one of those people\"". \n\nI have found much better places to spend my money on  weekly if not biweekly basis. I was never rude to any of your staff. I was always polite. Same with my bf. You have consistently screwed up over the last six months.\n\nOne final thought: I live very close by (that is why I spent so much money here! convenience!), and noticed a family entering your establishment. You might want to remove TYGA from your hold music if you are trying to be a family place. I've never heard of Tyga previously, and it was only while being on hold hearing \""bouncing on my d$%^ that I had to Google it to find out what the heck was being played. Do your associates choose your hold music??????????????\n\nAs an owner, I would ask myself \""did I hire new employees or new management within the last six months?\"" I am guessing so. Make the needed corrections before you permanently lose more regular customers. The food is amazing here. I've been here a few times and love it every time.

Every night, we would order food and at least one of us would drink.\n\nRecently, we showed up for our normal trivia night and upon asking what I wanted to drink I said water. It was cinco de mayo and I was probably going to have a drink, but hadn't made a choice yet. The waitress then told me that they are only serving bottled water after five now.\n\nWHAT? YOU WON'T SERVE ME WATER?\n\nI didn't get irritated at the waitress, she didn't make the rules we just wanted to talk to the manager.\n\nWhile waiting for the manager another tabled ordered water and were told the same thing. They also wanted to speak with the manager.The manager visited their table first and we listened in. After talking with them for a bit he said, \""Well one of your party has ordered 3 margaritas, it's ok for you to get water. From now on whenever you guys come in you can have water.\""\n\nThe manager then finished his conversation and came to visit us. He talked with us about how he didn't like people coming to trivia and just ordering water. (That is completely understandable) However, when I told him the situation of us being frequent visitors and that we always ordered food, he didn't seem to care. He asked if we were sitting in the same area last week and I replied yes. He then mentioned how he noticed we were drinking water and said this is a bar, you can't order food and get free water.\n\nWe then walked out.\n\n\n\n\nThis bar does not serve you free water AND on top of that, their food is not that good and overpriced. One of the advantages to being a Las Vegas local, are access to the resort pools.  The M Resort has an awesome deal for locals in the summer.  $10 for locals, but women can put their name on a list, and it is free entry for the rest of the summer.  Sorry guys, you still need to pay every time.  However, the last time I came, a friend had rented a daybed, and it was free but there was a minimum of $200 in food and drinks.  Well, a huge group of friends came out and did not have to pay entry because we all said we were there for the daybed under our friend's name.  And between the 20 of us, we definitely spent way more than the minimum requirement.  Best of all, the food and drinks were delish! The pitchers of margaritas and mojitos were pretty potent.  They did not skimp on the alcohol at all.  \n\nI also love that it is so kid friendly.  There are these huge entrance sections with only 10 inches of water and is the perfect place for the little ones to just wade in and splash.  The crowd is also a lot more laid back and chill than the strip resort pools. There are also a ton of families.  But, my favorite perk is the fact that it is not a long hike to get to the pool from the parking structure.  \n\nThe servers are super friendly and we rarely waited to get anyone's attention.  And if you are a guest of the hotel, definitely make time to relax poolside, soak in the vegas rays, and enjoy a cocktail.  \n\n*Yelp 100 Challenge: Review 50/100*",2,concat

Ok, I would have no problem tipping this bitch if she refilled my drink once, but to think she deserves anything more than $2 for the service I received is bullshit.  I was so mad at the shitty food and service, that I just wanted to leave the place and not even complain about her taking the extra money. I'm not a risktaker by any means.  I have three or four standard menu items that I order every single time from whichever place that I go to.  That's the extent of mixing it up, in my book.  My best friend, however, is different.  She likes to order new and odd things, try it, usually hates it and then I split half of my meal with her because she also refuses to return food for something better.\n\nWe both stumbled onto this place after an hour of indecision regarding where we would grab dinner.  Straightaway, I was impressed that there was a bar area and a separate glassed off section to keep the restaurant customers away from the musky smoke smell.\n\nOur waitress then came to take our order and I got a buffalo chicken wrap (as usual) and my friend got the steak sandwich.  She loved it and I got to eat my meal (which was amazing) in it's entirety.  After that, we split a small dessert, which came out HUGE.\n\nRight about the time that we had both finished eating, we hear the waitress inform another party that since it was Wednesday that all food was 50% off for a promotion they were running.  EXCUSE ME?!\n\nSo, we got great service, great food and only paid $16.00 for two meals and a dessert.  I was incredibly impressed by that.  Additionally, it's so close to my house that I intend to be a regular fixture at this place!",2,concat

I have never been in a dirtier, less visually appealing salon with the most unfriendly employees ever!  I went here specifically because of  the reviews.  Maybe I got spoiled living in CA (where every salon I went to for 11 years was clean, nicely decorated and had great employees), but in my opinion this place a dump.\n\nUpon entering the salon for the first time I had a hard time finding the front desk.  It's hidden around the corner.  The first thing you see when you walk in is a crappy shelving unit holding dirty goggles and towels.  And don't even get me started about the paint job or rest of the decor in this place.  I felt like I needed a shower upon entering this place.

I told her it was my first time at this salon and that I'd like to purhcase five tans in a level 2 bed.  I didn't even ask her any annoying questions because I'm capable of reading the board on the wall myself, yet she treated me like I just asked her for a kidney.  She threw a clipboard in my direction and said \""Fill this out.\""  I filled out the portion with my name and address and began checking yes or no to the additional questions on the waiver (that silly legal form that protects them from being sued).  She yelled at me that I didn't need to answer the questions and that I should just sign the bottom.  Ok, sure.  I can not answer any of the important questions that you might need to know about a new client....like whether or not I burn easily, etc.  I mentioned to her that I had not been tanning in over a year so I didn't want to go to the full time.  Typically when you go to a new salon they will recommend a time based on what they know about their beds.  She took my money and in the most annoyed voice ever said \""How long?\""  Ummmmm, I just told you I hadn't been tanning in a while, so again, I haven't been tanning in a while.  How long do you recommend?  Her response \""Seven????\""  A question.  Why are you asking me?  I know nothing about your level two beds and since you didn't have me answer any of those silly questions on your waiver I doubt you could make a proper recommendation anyway.  So sure, I guess seven is good.  Another customer happened to walk in behind me during this exchange and the girl behind the counter said \""follow me\"" and didn't say a word to the other customer.  A \""I'll be with you in just a moment\"" would have been completely appropriate and normal in this situation.\n\nSo I follow her down a narrow bright red hallway (that it looks like my nine year old painted) to a room with a flimsy folding door.  She then tells me to bring my dirty googles and towel back to the front and drop them in the baskets.  Wait...what???!  Do you want me to wipe down the bed and do a load of laundry for you too?  Why am I paying you for me to do your job for you?  I have NEVER been asked to clean up after myself at a tanning salon....EVER!  This made me wonder if they even go in there and clean the bed after I'm done.  So I fold my door behind her and latch it with the flimsy lock they've placed because a regular door lock won't work.  I put on my lotion in the tiny room (banging my elbows on the walls and bed in the four inch square space I have) and step into the stand up bed.  The lights eventually flicker on and I notive SEVERAL long hairs caught in the wiring surrounding the bed.  Now I realize this is perfectly normal, but if they cleaned the bed every once in a while they might pick out the long hairs that have been there for over two weeks now (as I've noticed in my subsequent visits).\n\nThe other two times I've been I've dealt with another girl who seems a little more friendly, but I have to say I'll be finishing up my five tan package and never return to this little hole again.  This place leaves so much to be desired.  For the amount they charge they need to clean up a little, repaint and consider having the employees do the cleaning instead of the customers.

She walked up and said, verbatim, \""what do you want?\"" I chose to ignore the attitude, and we placed our orders - a caesar salad and sauteed mushrooms for me, tortellini and a Shirley Temple for him with a side of garlic bread to share. They brought out the salad with bacon - I don't eat meat, my fault, I should have asked. However to describe the server's attitude as indignant would be an understatement. She started telling me about all the hassle it caused her to bring it back, and how I should know better than to assume it didn't have bacon, and couldn't I just pick it off? I've been in the industry for a few years and know that it doesn't matter - the customer is always right, she shouldn't have picked the fight. \n\nThe food was underwhelming. I was vomiting in the bathroom from my sauteed mushrooms which were not just poorly cooked but were clearly no longer fresh. The salad was bland, along with my boyfriend's meat sauce. When the server came back to check on how our food was tasting we were open with her. We told her that everything but the garlic bread was pretty awful. And then she walked away. She didn't ask how she could fix the problem (as any good server should have) nor did she sympathize or ask us to explain what was wrong. She didn't even acknowledge us. She just walked off to the next table without words nor utterances. When I eventually managed to call her back after what was literally five or ten minutes of her ignoring me I informed her that because the food left me throwing up in the bathroom I would like my meal to be taken off the bill. And that's where she lost it. \n\n\""What? Oh no no, I can't do that.\"" She turned away to leave again. \""Excuse me,\"" I said, \""It's made me sick.\"" She looked at me like I was stupid \""Well I can't just TAKE IT OFF, oh no, of course not. If you're not happy with your meal I can grab the manager or call the police.\"" I can't invent that. She threatened to CALL THE POLICE because we were unhappy with the food. I asked to speak to the manager and she said she'd grab him in a few minutes as he was busy. We spent about twenty or twenty five minutes (my boyfriend checked his watch!) waiting for him while I was huddled into my booth, trying to make my stomachache go away. Eventually she just dropped off the bill (without a word, of course) and left. Naturally, we didn't tip. When she returned she saw the bill and counted out the bills and coins we'd left for her. \""Wow, thanks,\"" she said, sarcastically \""don't feel like you have to come back here again.\"" I'm not joking. She actually said that. \n\nTo their credit, our experience seemed to be an uncommon one. It seems like their pizza is pretty good, but unfortunately the server didn't exactly want us coming back.

The options are vegan or vegetarian and they always have fresh fruit and fresh baked breads. The dessert table is usually various pies and bundt cakes. The flavors are great and subtle too.\n\nIt's a small space so if you're claustrophobic or don't like beat sat with strangers this most likely isn't for you.

The wings tasted like cardboard and the tenders tasted like dirty socks. It was soaked in oil. A cholesterol overdose. \nThe fries were ok. It was disgusting. Dr. Besemer,  Dr. Kieran, and their entire staff are truly amazing, compassionate animal caregivers. \n\nWhen my two-year-old kitty became extremely ill during this past weekend, we were able to get him examined by Dr. Besemer on Sunday. At that point, we had no idea what the issue was, and all of the blood work and tests came back in the normal range (the doctor took the time to work him in between surgeries and sit down with us for an extremely thorough review of our kitty's test results and examination findings). We took the kitty home for the night with meds to ease his tummy issues, but the next morning it was quite apparent that the little guy was getting worse. \n\nWe took him back in (after calling the staff, who was very willing to get him in ASAP), and he got another thorough exam, this time by Dr. Kieran, as Dr. Besemer was booked in surgeries. All of the kitty's history had been communicated to Dr. Kieran, and she recommended x-rays. (It should be noted at this point that at every step we were given a complete write-up of treatment recommendations and their costs, the pros and cons of each, and given full control over what we thought was the correct thing to do based on all of the facts.) We chose to get the x-rays done, and about 10 minutes later, Dr. Kieran went over the entire picture with us and explaining what we were seeing. There was a suspicious-looking, but not blatantly apparent spot around the kitty's intestinal area. We were given the choice of getting an ultrasound or going in that afternoon for exploratory surgery. Again, both procedures, their associated risks, and costs (very reasonable financing terms are available) were immediately and thoroughly communicated to us. We chose surgery, and Dr. Kieran took him right in. We went home to wait for an update on our beloved kitty's condition. We were told how long to expect the surgery to last, and were told that we could call at any time for a status update. (Never once were we treated like a bother.)\n\nRight around the time they had estimated, we were called by Dr. Kieran, who told us the surgery went well and they had removed an obstruction from our kitty's intestine. We were given a choice whether to pick him up and keep him overnight ourselves or keep him at the clinic for IV fluids and monitoring. (The clinic does not have 24-hour staff, but recommended 24 hour care nearby or what we could do to care for him ourselves throughout the night.) We chose to take him home and bring him back in early the next morning for an all-day stay to make sure he was well-hydrated and get him started eating again. They wrapped up the little catheter on his front paw so they did not have to stick him with another needle the next morning. They gave him all the medications he'd need in the evening before we left and in the morning after we brought him back, except for pain meds to keep him comfortable during the night. We were even able to see the object that was causing the obstruction, which ended up being a large hairball that had dried and hardened in the middle and lodged in there. \n\nThat night was rough sleep wise for me, but it was worth it to see my kitty making a speedy recovery. In the morning I dropped him off, and when I picked him up in the evening, the transformation was amazing. We were given after-care instructions, food, medication, and happily brought him home last night.  \n\nDr. Kieran called this morning to see how the kitty was doing and answer any questions I had.

It was all served family style so that everyone could try some of everything. I have never had such great pieces of steak...ever. The skirt steak was definitely the winner of the three cuts.

It was a Saturday night and well, being Vegas, all the good restaurants were already booked. Now, I know that we could have gone to any restaurant but we were starving and that was the only place we could get. The restaurant is at The Palazzo and located in the lowest level of the hotel. It was actually really hard to find and feared that because we were late, our reservation had been canceled. No such thing. Upon finally arriving, we checked in with the hostess. While we waited to be seated, a bride and groom (it is Vegas after all) went up to the hostess and asked if they could accommodate a party of 23. They said they were willing to wait since it was a walk-in. The manager comes out and says that it will take about 15 minutes. Now, THAT should have been my first clue. Sadly, I thought nothing of it.\n\nThe hostess tells us that our table is ready, so we go in. Looking around, I didn't see that many people but again, didn't think twice about it. \n\nOur waiter comes to greet us and take our drink order. A few of us decide to get a bottle of wine while another one asked for a virgin daiquiri. The waiter tells her that they don't make frozen drinks there. So, she gets a Shirley Temple. Now, the wine selection was not that impressive and to be quite honest, they prices were a bit high.  \n\nWe get our drinks and now it's time to order.  2 get the Tuna Tartare, another on gets the Salad di Campo (which is just greens with yellow red pear tomatoes with lemon olive oil) and I get the Caesar salad. while waiting for the appetizers, we munched on the bread and this delicious pesto-type dip. The appetizers are here, yay! What a big let down. \n\nLet's start with the Tuna Tartare: the description said it was a spicy fresh tuna with a balsamic reduction and micro arugula. It was neither spicy nor fresh. The balsamic reduction was a drizzle on the plate, not even on the tuna. Oh and the micro arugula consisted of a sprinkle of little teeny-tiny leaves, so that was true to the description.\n\nThe salads were basic, nothing special about them.\n\nOur waiter comes and asks how our food is. We tell him that the tuna does not taste fresh and it's pretty much a disgusting dish. He asks if we want the kitchen to make a new. Hmm, let me see. . . that would be a no! We asked for something completely different and off he went. The new appetizers were Crab Cakes and a Caprese salad. The salad was good, the crab cakes were not. We didn't say anything else because we feared that our food would get spit on.\n\nThe entrees come and we all look at each other not know what to expect and hoping to be pleasantly surprised. Sadly, that was not the case. We ordered the following: Veal Milanese, Prosciutto Pizza, Pasta with chicken and NY steak with a peppercorn brandy cream sauce.\n*sigh*\n\nThe veal was crusted with  panko bread crumbs but it was so dry, cutting it was next to impossible.  Presentation wise, the pasta was a big mess but it was edible. The pizza was nice and crispy with a generous amount of prosciutto and an even more generous amount of arugula. Upon first impression, the steak looked good. However, when trying to cut it, it disappointed. I say \""trying\"" because it was so tough, I had to struggle with it. It was then that I realized I was using a butter knife so I asked for a steak knife. I thought that would solve the cutting issue but again, that was not the case. I could not cut a piece for the life of me. I was arm wrestling it, no joke. The manager happened to stop by as I am doing that and asks how our food was. (I assume he heard about the tuna tartare) I tell him my steak is so tough I can't even cut it with the steak knife. So he asks if he can try to cut me a piece. Even HE struggled with it but played it off like I wasn't cutting it right. He then has the nerve to ask me what was wrong with. Really? He suggest maybe cooking it a little bit more (it was med-rare) and I tell him that that's not the problem. The problem was the big tendon-nerve running through the whole meat. I tell him that I don't want it and do not want anything else in its place. Boy was he mad! He took it and said nothing.\n\nNot once, did he apologize or even PRETEND to feel bad for our experience. Quite frankly, we felt that we were the inconvenience and not the other way around. To be honest, we felt a bit disrespected for having spoken up. With so many restaurants and so many choices, one would think that they would go out of their way to make our dining experience a pleasant one. Our waiter never came back, that's how bad it was.\n\nI hope that although a bit long, my review helps you in deciding whether to patronize this restaurant. Stevie at the print/copy shop is awesome! She bend over backwards to help me and got me out of there quickly with exactly what I wanted at a price I fully expected.",2,concat

I was NOT about to wait till 6:30PM to have my room ready nor wait forever  for them to \""call me\"" or accidently forget. so my bf and i just gambled at cosmo till 3pm..i physically went back to the lobby and check myself and he said it was ready!\n\n*so note for you guys, dont wait till 6:30PM  or for them to call you for your room to be ready..check it yourself..physically!\n\ni love their parking structure haha is that weird? love the art on the walls, very modernized parking structure...showing how many spaces are left and little lights showing you a occupied space or not haha\n\noverall, i would def stay here again if i had another special occasion or if theres a great deal since it is a bit pricey but well worth the money. make sure to stop by the identity booth for a free spin at their wheel to get free stuff and plays!",2,concat

The experience I had last night is a prime reason why I've never been one to patronize the club scene, particularly in Scottsdale. First to be offered a \""FREE Bottle/Table\"" for my *BIRTHDAY* but then required to \""TIP\"" someone for service they have not provided yet I find totally misleading. This does not make it free. Second to have someone request to hold on to my ID & debit card to secure this \""free\"" bottle & table is another ploy to try & coax someone into having an open tab. Third when brought to the attention of the \""manager\"" Bradley, to be lied to about the resolution they have offered adds insult to injury, not to mention the service that we finally did receive was horrible. The waitress was inattentive, took glasses away from the table that were being used & left glasses on the table that clearly were not. I am contacting the Roxy directly to let them know I'm totally dissatisfied with the service & the whole experience & plan to dispute any charges they have placed on my card because if there were supposedly a value placed the horrible service we received it would not be more than $5, not even actual cost of the cheap Stanford Governor's Cuv\u00e9e Brut Champagne that was served, which was worth only $8.00 a bottle. Even at a 100% mark-up for the \""free\"" bottle wasn't worth $50. The crowd that the club attracts is not one that I feel comfortable being a part of & the \""music\"" I don't listen to. I will be 38 years old on Tuesday & have a completely different definition of partying & how to have a good time.  Needless to say I did not enjoy this & unlikely to attend any other events.

He is interested in baking in a lot of money per customer, as opposed to taking on customers to actually help them out.  My evidence is below:\n\nI called Matthew on Thursday, July 24th to ask if I could get a quote on a yard clean up.  He said yes and came out the next week.  Instead of calling me, he emails me a quote with only 2 options. 1) $375 for a major overhaul of my bushes (that I never asked for) or 2) $150 monthly to clean the yard.  (twice a month).  I only want a clean up once a month, and Matthew rejected the business. I might even have paid $150 for once a month.\n\nMake no mistake--Matthew is trying to make as much money per customer as possible--and it is in his interest to do so--not yours.  He doesnt care what you need--he wants those customers he desires.  I've seen that behavior a lot in Arizona, but being originally from the east coast I am used to hard working companies who genuinely want to help you out.\n\nStay away from Matthew. Holy smokes! this place was incredible. We just went here on Friday night before we went to see \""O\"". This was my birthday dinner and I could not have been happier. First, the three olive tapanades that came out with the bread were super tasty. My husband and I shared the fig and prosciutto flat bread...it was big! Definitely too much for the two of us but I'm so glad we ordered it. For dinner, I had the halibut with shrimp risotto. Seriously...this was the best halibut I have ever had. There was about a dozen shrimp on my plate that were cooked to perfection. The sauce was amazing...mushrooms and some greens. seriously one of the best meals I've ever had. Husband ordered the Adobo Tuna with some polenta and it was as good if not better than mine. Unfortunately we had no room for dessert but because it was my b-day they brought us out a small plate of truffles, lemon, chocolate and hazelnut. Even those were amazing. The service was great, I would say by far my favorite restaurant in Vegas. I wish we would have requested the patio so we could watch the bellagio water show. We could actually still see it from inside the restaurant but next time we'll definitely request the patio. If you want delicious food and a great environment, don't skip this place.",2,concat

I came back 30 minutes later and picked up my car. I walked around it and noticed it looked like they had dried it off with dirty towels. I also noticed my tires had tire shine on them. I had them wipe off what they could, and wiped off the smudges on the paint. I tipped the guy and left. I got down to the grocery store and got out to discover black tire shine spots all over both sides of my white car. I got back in my car and went back to the car wash.

Not sure if it was just a bad day, but the food was not seasoned at all. There was no salt, pepper or any other seasoning in their food. We ordered duck confit omelet, and eggs benedict.

Then it's the complimentary bread basket with three different types of olive tapenade for the table, they're very delicious btw. \n\nA few menu recommendations:\n\nFig & Prosciutto flatbread - This has to be the best Fig & Prosicutto combo I've ever had. The sweet Fig jam goes perfect with the Gorgonzola cheese. The rosemary crust is a nice touch.\n\nButternut Squash Tortelli - Very tasty Vegetarian pasta dish. The sauce is a little on the heavy side in my opinion.\n\n\nAnother honorable mention is the Jumbo sea Scallops, served in this sweet & sour glaze on a bed of Arugula salad. However, as delicious as this dish is, I don't recommend if you're hungry or if you're looking to get your money's worth. You get about 6 scallops with this dish and it's $39\n\nFlatbreads, sandwiches & pastas are $14-$22;  main entrees are $26-$60 (steaks are in the $50-$60 ballpark). Cocktails are $12-$18.  Champagnes are $110+ per bottle.\n\nThe restaurant itself is trendy but very comfortable; and even though it does have a romantic atmosphere, I wouldn't really recommend it as a date place, as it tend to get very noisy during dinner time. It is however, a great place to dine with family (adults) and friends. I would not recommend this place for children. Reservations recommended.",2,concat

The bartenders are rude, the people are unattractive and dancers have a nasty attitude. Also,  the toilets in the girls bathroom were overflowing for the 40 minutes we were there. No one turned off the water valve on the back of the toilet. Some creeper guy just kept mopping up the continuous flow of sewage. Ulta is quickly overtaking my love of Sephora since it is so much closer and so easily assisible. They are also beginning to carry more high end brands like Lancome and Benefit. I like that they have a better selection of salon hair products as well as the drugstore brands. NYX is sold here and often goes on sale for buy one get one half off. If you're a follower of beauty blogs you can appreciate the NYX brand as an inexpensive beauty find. This particular store is huge, which allows for plenty of room to meander and shop.

We were treated special the minute we walked thru the door.  I am not a big Chinese fan but this was well worth the price.  We started with a sampling of two appetizers, the chicken lettuce wrap and a spicy prawn dumpling.  Both of these were hot and fresh.  The first two appetizers were followed by a second plate of a pot sticker and honey glazed ribs.  Our main course was spice scallops and wok fried pepper tenderloin that came out hot and fresh.  Which now days it is very unusual to have your food much hotter than the serving dish since so many places not reheat their entrees.  We were also served lobster fried rice and mixed Chinese vegetables.  Finally our desert was a trio of pastries.  We had a chocolate bananan torte, cr\u00e8me brulee, and a wonderful cold parfait.

They were having great time while customers were waiting. They got the order messed up and then had to wAit 40 minutes for a to go burger. Management please do something! Review # 500. Wow. When it came time to choose what to review for #500, I felt it was time to give some recognition to the city that has transformed my life, Las Vegas. On a cold, snowy night in the front range of the Colorado Rockies high above Denver things were bleak and we were miserable. And my wife and I decided we had had enough. Christmas morning we opened presents, then packed them into the back of a Penske truck and up and over the mountains we went. After 2 days of driving through a snowpocalypse we topped the hill right around sunset and there she was...Fabulous Las Vegas in all her brightly lit glory. She was...and quite frankly still is a sight to behold, especially at night. \n\nMy stay here has had some low points. As we didn't know the city that well, we first stayed in a drug infested extended stay hotel on Boulder Highway with a meth dealer on one side, a spice dealer on the other, and Metro knocking on the wrong door at 2 am was not the way one wants to meet the city's finest with badges. We had a guy who runs a local gay bar and was dating my sister in law call Child Protective Services on her entire family including us, all as retaliation against her despite the fact he beat the heck out of her and was trying to divert attention from that. Thanks Russ, we passed our drug tests and came out clean, thank you very much for the free State of Nevada funded lab work you jackass. And we got to work for a local contractor, Robert Half Technology that was the worst company my wife and I ever worked for. When we lost our jobs a week apart we almost lost our ass but we were absolutely thrilled to be free of Robert Half. \n\nBut while there's been some bad, the good beats it 10,000 to 1. I've met some of the most talented, creative, and downright inspiring people here. Thanks to Yelp and the wonderful Misti Y. who helped me get started Yelping again after a break, I turned Yelp into my exploration tool to discover Vegas. I've learned a lot about Thai food, had my first tapas, and even learned that Ramen is not the .19 cent per cellophane wrapped package stuff, it's a hand made wonderful thing to indulge yourself with and Vegas has a couple of great Ramen places. I enjoyed exploring the Strip and all that it has to offer, found JP's awesome chocolates, and things like Kiehl's which changed my life. And then there's Fremont Street...where almost every time I step foot on it ...as Loverboy sang during a free concert down there I'm \""Lovin every minute of it!\"". And I ended up at Fremont during Pride weekend by accident and it was over the top incredible. \n\nStep away from the lights and you have some of the sweetest single track mountain bike trails imaginable, Lake Mead and the spectacular Hoover Dam and that mind blowing bridge are essentially in my back yard. I love the views of Mt. Charleston and Valley of Fire. I've watched the Nascar Sprint Cup race from LVMS, I've been caught in a thunderstorm twice on Lake Mead and while scared like never before we made it through. And I even managed to get into the Global Gaming Expo and play slot machines that the public hasn't even seen yet...and I got to go to CES, which if you love electronics was like the most over the top experience imaginable. Vegas...she's been good to me. I'm glad to be here. And thank you to everyone here on Yelp who has followed me, gave me tips and advice, and helped me to truly make this city my new home. While Kansas City is my hometown, Vegas is a great place to be...and I admit I love being here.",2,concat

We paid 88ish total for the two of us. It's definitely hard to get your moneys worth here unless your fine eating crappy tasting food. \n\nFOOD:\nThe two most expensive things here are probably the crab legs and the prime rib. I don't really eat much cooked seafood, so I didn't eat the crab. I love steak, so I loaded up on the PRIME RIB. Unfortunately, it tasted like DOG FOOD. That spoiled my appetite and I couldn't eat much more. \n\nThe rest of the food offered was super cheap stuff like hometown buffet-esque. I had some cheap chicken wings, pasta, etc. Everything tasted very subpar. \n\nThe gelato used to be pretty good, but I think they get it from somewhere else now. It's much worse than before. It tasted very cheap and low quality and the texture was kind of melty. I had some lemon meringue and orange white chocolate cake that was pretty decent, but thats the only thing I semi-enjoyed. \n\nOverall, I DO NOT RECOMMEND Wicked Spoon.

Additionally, I let her know to take the food orders first, because that typically takes the longest.\n\nWe placed our food order at 7PM, followed shortly after by drink orders.

I asked multiple times to speak to the general manager and the hostess and waitress flat out refused.

I'd like the start by saying the pharmacists here are skilled and knowledgeable, even if they never remember who I am.  The techs they have working here are another story, Not only are they not skilled, and not knowledgeable, they very obviously lack general customer service skills.  \n\nI have two of my scripts set up on auto fill, every 90 days.  For those of you not familiar with the auto fill concept, it's supposed to take the hassle out of refilling your drugs, with the pharmacy taking care of contacting your Dr and filling it on time.  In the last 12 months, my auto fill has been messed up 3x, considering it only fills 4x a year, that's not really impressive.  Each time it's been a different excuse, and each time I end up making multiple phone calls and trips to the pharmacy to get it straightened out.  This last time, it took me 3 phone calls and 3 trips.  \n\nThe techs with whom I spoke to on the phone were rude and argumentative.  After I gave up on calling and went in person, with a reasonable solution, Ada (the tech attempting to assist me) spent a solid 15 minutes arguing with me, insisting what I was asking for could not be done.  Since this wasn't my first rodeo with Cvs, (I had them perform this request before), I knew I was being bs'd.  While a line of angry people formed behind me, she got flustered and took a phone call.  Apparently she decided she was no longer going to help me.  One of the pharmacists stepped up to help the next person in line, and she told him to help me instead.  I explained my plight to him, and he resolved it in less than 2 minutes.  \n\nThe moral of this story is if the techs don't know how to do, they will tell you it can't be done.  They have no interest in actually helping you, and are not concerned with the lack of customer service they provide.  On my last call, I informed the tech that I found her inability to provide a solution unacceptable, and her response was I can't change it....no admission of guilt, not even an apology, just pure attitude and contempt.  So go ahead, mess up my prescription, catch an attitude with me and refuse to fix it.  I'm sure that will work out for you in the long run. I have been here a few times and had a great experience every time. The food is wonderful (creative, fancy yet totally edible), the ambiance is cozy, sophisticated and classy, and the service is spot on.

Make sure your \nshorts are either above your knees or that you're wearing pants, because the security guards at the front apparently have this idea that shorts below the knee are simply too long to enter this five star establishment. I didn't realize that this was some division of the Ritz Carlton, perhaps they would have provided me with a pair of pants had there been an issue. Little did they know my shorts were stuffed with ridiculous amounts of money, how unfortunate. Go tuck yourself in, Mr. Security Guard. I'll find somewhere that appreciates a good pair of shorts in the mean time. My baby daughter goes here and I am very pleased with the level of interaction and care she receives.  \n\nWhen I was looking for a daycare for her I toured several, and even considered the same daycare that my 5 year old son had attended for the last 4 years right down the road (but had left a few months prior due to his recent attitude problems at that daycare).  I needed to know that my tiny, fragile, premature daughter would be in good hands.  I graded the daycare centers that I toured on the compassion I felt and level of competency I sensed from the daycare director, the interaction from the teachers and amenities I noted in the baby room, the cleanliness of the facility and the general sense I had of the place.  The weekly price wasn't my main concern, although it CERTAINLY wasn't a non-issue.  \n\nOne daycare I looked at seemed nice (they even had a sign in the lobby stating that they watched children free of charge for interviewing parents, which I thought was sweet) but I didn't like the way the place smelled and the baby room seemed too small.  Another place didn't have an appropriate outdoor play place for the tots, and that wasn't okay with me, even though in every other sense they were a contender.\n\nBut when I toured Maxwell I was very impressed with the whole center.  The center was spacious, bright, colorful and had lots and lots of children's artwork decorating the walls.  Although my child is far too small for it, there is a RAD, two-story indoor play town with a slide and other neat things for the older kids for when it is too hot for them to safely play on the outside playground.  The director, Kristin, was knowledgeable and attentive to my questions.  The baby room teachers seemed sincere and down to earth, and the baby room itself was clean, bright and colorful.  I read though the parent handbook and the enrollment paperwork they offered, and somewhere in the explanation of what services they guaranteed to provide to your child on a daily basis was a promise that they would hug your child each day.  I thought that was neat.  (I mean, it's assumed that a daycare will be affectionate and caring towards your small child when you take them there, but how many of them actually promise you that your child will get a hug each day??)  Anyway, the rates and registration fees were competitive and everything else checked out with me so I enrolled my baby there.\n\nNow, we've been going there almost a year, and to be honest there have been one or two times where I was annoyed at other parents for doing some (thoroughly) annoying things, like clogging up the circular driveway in front as they leisurely dropped off their child and chatted with other people in the hallway (as opposed to parking over in the parking lot if they wanted to take their sweet time in the daycare center and saving the driveway for the parents in a hurry), or even worse people parking behind me in the driveway when I already had someone parked in front of me and basically trapping my car as I waited for either one of them to move so I could get out (GRR!!).  But overall I am very, very happy.  My baby girl LOVES her morning and afternoon teachers, and has no separation issues at all when I drop her off because she is always so excited to see them and start playing.  \n\nAnd I can tell that they genuinely love her over there.  In fact, she had a small surgery that required a two night hospital stay not long after we started going to MPA and her teacher called to check on her condition after her surgery.  Then she got really sick earlier this year with RSV and spent two different stints at Phoenix Children's Hospital, of more than a week each stay, not only did MPA NOT charge me for the time she was away (believe it or not, some places actually would) but they also made her a get well card that had at least a dozen teachers signatures and messages for her written on there, and her morning teacher also came clear over to PCH to see her and give her hugs!  She was so happy to see her.  :)  That meant a lot to me.  \n\nAlso, twice now my vacation time has fallen about 4 weeks before my bi-annual vacation credit was due and they still let me take the week off without a charge.  It was SO appreciated during these very tight times!\n\nAnyway, this is a GREAT daycare center!  Love them! :)",2,concat

There was something way more wrong there than her just being \""new\"". \n\nWhen our food finally made it, she couldn't even remember who had ordered what out of all 2 OF US AT THE TABLE. And to top it all off the food was disgusting. Mozz sticks were obviously frozen,sauce had no flavor. I got chick parm stromboli, it came out soggy, somewhat cold, and just gross.

It'll make your plate full of food look small.\n\nI went for their infamous southern fried chicken and sweet potato and green bean with potatoes for my sides. It was the best fried chicken I've ever had! There's just enough batter to chicken. The skin is crispy and the chicken is actually moist! I could pass on the green beans (they tasted like canned green beans), but the sweet potato was awesome. The sweet potato had just enough sweetness, but you have to ignore the (possibly heart stopping) liquid it sits in. Sometimes it better not to know how some stuff are made. =P\n\nMy hubby tried their chicken fried steak with rice and gravy and potato salad. The chicken fried steak has a flavorful, thick batter but it's still crispy. It totally looks homemade. The rice is your standard stuff, but the potato salad is yummy. \n\nThey're open 7 days a week, but they close early at 7PM, so plan an early dinner!

We're new to Phoenix and happened upon this restaurant by accident.  We looked at the menu and decided to get the 3 tacos for $5.00 and a bottle of water for $6.00 total.  Menu prices include tax and they accept cash only.\n\nI had 2 chicken tacos while my wife tried a fish taco.  Included on each taco is:  Beans, cheese, tomatoes, onions, shredded cabbage, rice, a choice of meat, which green sauce and red salsa on the side.  \n\nThese aren't tiny taco bell tacos.  These things are huge and delicious!  My wife loved her fish taco and the chicken tacos were also fantastic.  We can't wait to go back.  \n\nMy only wish was that I had black beans on my tacos instead of pinto beans, but my wife looked at their menu online later and found that I could have requested them.

The deviled eggs from a variety of fowl was more like hard boiled eggs then deviled eggs.  Lamb chops had a nice flavor but came out before they had the chance to settle.  Fish over couscous was a disaster.  Conceptually the dish was suppose to be freshly cooked hot fish over cold couscous - this was verified by the server.  I don't see how this is a good idea because when you combine a hot element with a cold element you just get lukewarm, especially when one is piled on top of the other.  The fish was actually lukewarm because of a mistake in the kitchen.  \n\nDespite having a reservation the flustered server at the door asked us to check out the restaurant's attached shop.  It was quite a while before the server greeted our table.  Everything was fine until we waited over 35 minutes between the starters and entrees.  It is painfully obvious that the fish dish was cooked before the kitchen realized they forgot to fire the lamb chops.  Instead of re-cooking the fish the kitchen decided to send it out cold along with the sizzling chops.  \n\nUpon sending the dish back the server asked if we'd like anything else.  After explaining to her that I did not wish to prolong an unsatisfactory experience she sent over what appeared to be another server.  The gentlemen asked if there was anything else we would like and I just asked for the bill.  He barked at me 'there is no bill tonight' and quickly walked away without saying anything else or allowing me the opportunity to say anything else.

Then, we decided to walk over to the brewery because they also serve ribs, but we got there at 10:03pm and they close at 10pm.\n\nHubby had been driving and driving around like he usually does and couldn't make up his mind where we should eat. Of course, hours go by and we've just completely missed the boat. A couple who were waiting by the brewery said they'd been there for 45 minutes and still were not seated. GODAMMIT. Lil guy was now starving.\n\nSo there was only one thing left. Metro Pizza. The stuff looked like it'd been sitting there forever. OK the good thing is that these pizza slices were paper thin (the way I like my pizza).\n\nWe waited a long time since the guy behind near the oven was on his cell phone. 8-10 mins go by and another guy comes over and helps us. Lil guy wanted a slice of pepperoni and hubby and I got the combo topping selection. Boy, the guy didn't even put it into the oven for us and I didn't know to ask.\n\nWe sit down and lil guy immediately said \""mommy, this is really greasy\"". He had picked up the slice and his plate had a pool of oil just laying there. I would've taken a photo but my hands were greasy from my own slice so I decided not to soil my camera.\n\nI ended up using about 10 napkins to soak up some of the oil from lil guy's pizza.

I was very excited to see this new salad place open up, and even more excited about how great it was after trying it!! \n\nIf you order a customized salad and skip out on the protein option (meats) and cheese option, you can leave paying about $6.50. As you add meat, cheese, or extras, you'll end up spending more. It can be pricey for salad, but they DO use very high quality & healthy ingredients (like kale & spinach, quinoa, goat cheese, cashews, free range chicken, edamame, blueberries, wild grilled salmon, etc etc). To save money, I like to add cashews or some other type of non-meat protein & pay less than $9. I am more than willing to pay this much for a salad when I know that I am getting the highest quality & healthiest ingredients. They give you a pretty good sized portion, and it is the only place I've found where the food is delicious, I feel satisfied for hours afterward, and I still feel great about what I've eaten!\n\nThis has quickly become my favorite lunch spot downtown. It can get very busy, but calms down late in the afternoon. It is also noteworthy to mention that the people who work here are extremely nice!

The light group promised me a refund right after the event which I have still not received.  We paid $330 for two people, waited until 11:40 in line for a show that started at 10, and then we were let into a club in which you could not move an inch in any direction. I actually had a 50 somethings breast in my face and could not move to remove them. I couldn't get to the bar to get a drink nor to the railing to even catch a glimpse of Bruno. This was suppose to be a fairy tale night for my husband and I. It took us 10 minutes to push our way out of the club, ripping my purse in the process. It was truly scary and I am not a woman who scares easily. This was billed as an intimate evening with Bruno  Mars. I am not so naive that I thought it would be intimate, but it was so crowded it was unsafe. I am not claustrophobic, and usually I enjoy the energy of a crowd. Someone should make this right. I feel Like we were scammed. On DC Ranch's Market Street, located in the same building where San Felipe used to reside, sits a new Italian restaurant...Mia Francesca.\nOnly Mia Francesca isn't a new entity. It's been around for a good long while in Chicago with twenty locations. In other words, they're a solid act.\nFinally.\nAfter all of its predecessors who've come and gone on Market Street, it would appear this place might have some staying power. I can only hope.\n\nThe service was all of five stars...friendly, enthusiastic, informative and fast. The fast piece of it was surprising given every table was filled both inside and out.\nThe food, even better with two nice surprises.\n\nThe rigatoni bolognese had a couple large chunks of braised beef, this in addition to the ground beef typically found in a traditional bolognese sauce. As I said, a nice surprise.\nThe other was the veal medallions. I was shocked upon their delivery.\nDescribed on the menu as simply medallions in a light cream sauce atop roasted veggies and mashed potatoes, these were no ordinary medallions.\nA medallion in most restaurants is a small, silver dollar sized slice of meat approximately half-inch thick...if you're lucky.\n\nThese 'medallions' were mini filet mignons...three of them, cooked to perfection. \nSeared and caramelized outside, medium rare inside. The roasted veggies looked like shitake mushrooms but they could have been another variety, not sure. The light cream sauce was truly that...very light cream with more of an au jus texture. So flavorful, it made me eat the mashed potatoes. And I don't eat mashed potatoes. Ever.\n\nThe pre meal bread was roasted and served warm. Crusty shell and moist crumb. \nThe house salad is large enough to spilt and I highly recommend the light balsamic dressing, slightly tangy but pairs beautifully with chianti or sangiovese.\n\nMeal with tip was ninety dollars with plenty of leftovers for todays lunch.\nTruly a pleasant dining experience. \n\nNice job on getting the 'bugs' worked out so quickly on your new AZ venture MF.\nKeep it up and I can see where it won't be long before you have twenty locations in Phoenix, just like Chicago!",2,concat

When I tried to talk to the manager a very rude female would not give me her name and said that it would take about 45 min to an hour.  She refused to give me any information on the manager saying that his name was private information.  Their only remedy was to give me 20% off and remake the pizza and redelivered.  I would never tell anyone to eat here and will tell all my vet buddies and associates to never order their pizza.  I hope the manager or owner sees this post and contacts me.  Navy.dav91@gmail.com I'm writing this review as I am about to embark on another LV journey with the girls.. A bit ago, me & j went on a LV trip- first time going with an other without a group of my girls (was sad they werent there!)\n\nTruth is, I dont really know how to gamble. I hate buffets. So for a person like me, i go to Vegas for the lavish hotels, morning mojitos, the tricked out pools, and the like. Encore provided just that. Anyone that has walked through Encore knows that the colorful interior with the mosaic tiles and slightly asian inspired (subtle) decor makes for sophisticated without crossing the line over to gaudiness.\n\nThe spa lounge area (can see it when one is crossing over to the XS pool area) is soo pristine- i wished my gfs to be there- they would have gotten excited about it more than J! The pool itself has two sections. One is directly connected to the spa and on the other side is the European style \""xs pool\"" - although we didnt see more than 3 brazen topless women, it was a big area for sunning and playing blackjack (same area they do at nighttime at the club)\n\n\nAs for the rooms, we had requested a \""quiet suite\"" since Encore is known to have loud music coming from XS at 4 in the morning.. so we got a north facing room.. Not the greatest view (just small strip plaza) but the King Suite (which is the smallest room at Encore I believe) was pretty spacious for 2 people.\n\nAnother thing- I dont know if anyone else notices but the music they constantly play in the casino is by Kaskade. I've heard at least 3 Kaskade songs during this stay and I remember hearing her 3 years ago when i was in this hotel as well- and i actually went home to look up who this artist was- and has made a permanent spot on my ipod playlist. For those that know of this artists work, it adds a serene element to the casino.\n\nOne of the only negatives to Encore/Wynn properties.. they are so damn far from everything else! We spent most of the trip at this hotel (except for the dinner/show which we cabbed to Bellagio- but the cab driver insisted taking some freeway looking road to get from Encore to Bellagio due to traffic ??)\n\nThey sometimes send deals over- one that i got in the mail which was 3 nights for 300 (incl weekends)- Except J threw it away and we didnt get to use it! So if you get one in the mail, take the offer! This place will be worth your stay.",2,concat

We were seated right away both times (yay) but waited at least 10-15 minutes before the server acknowledge our presence. The place isn't big at all so even if you're busy you can at least say hello to your table!\n\nThe first time, I ordered the grilled cheese sandwich with potato salad. The sandwich is ginormous and 90% bread and 10% cheese. While the cheese was yummy, you could barely taste it with all that frikkin bread. Should be more cheesy in my opinion. Shrug. But to each his own. And the server gave me chips instead of potato salad. When I asked her to bring me the salad, she seemed perturbed. Geez! It was your mistake, not mine.\n\nThe second time, we waited 15 minutes to order, very frustrating. Especially when you only have an hour for lunch. I ordered the two eggs over easy with chive potatoes and bacon. For $11 I expected something goooood. WRONG. My eggs arrived well over medium (no gooey yolk to dip my bacon in, booooo.) The potatoes were overcooked and maybe four bites worth, and the bacon way too crispy. Guess the cook forgot about my breakfast and just let it sit there overdone. \n\nWhen I asked for jam for my toast, again the server seemed hassled by my request. Is it just me? Do I have a booger on my face? I didn't ask for new eggs because I don't like to complain (nor do I risk saliva or snot in my food). Very disappointed at both of my visits.\n\nThis place has let me down twice in guest experience and food. I will never go again. Overrated. Hey, every other lunch spot in the neighborhood. You'd better watch out! Caf\u00e9 Zupas has arrived.\n\nI was a huge fan of the first Vegas location on Eastern Ave. Now that they've opened much closer to home, I'm ready to forsake that original spot altogether. Caf\u00e9 Zupas delivers soups, salads, and sandwiches with fresh ingredients and in-house dressings with great service. They always have someone at the door, they always clear tables without taking tips, and they follow a carefully crafted script of questions that gets customers through the line efficiently while also upselling on things like desserts and drinks. The foods are not what you would call authentic, but they are delicious Americanized renditions.\n\nI always get the try 2 combo ($8.29), where you get to choose 2 of 3 items from whole sandwiches, half soups, and half salads. Regardless of the weather (read: summer heat), I almost always get a half soup with a sandwich. The soups that I've tried are all really good. The lobster bisque and the roasted red pepper and lobster may not have real lobster, but they're both delicious. This week, I've really grown to love the wild mushroom bisque and the tomato basil. This location seems to serve their bread almost cold, so dip it fully in the soup to warm it up.\n\nAs for sandwiches, I definitely steer toward the ciabatta bread sandwiches rather than the panini sandwiches. The honey cilantro carnitas sandwich, which is a relatively new item, is very impressive because of its glaze, the pork, and the avocado. BBQ pulled pork sandwich and Italian club sandwich are also long-time favorites, and turkey cranberry is a nice reminder of my favorite holiday. Cuban grilled pork is alright if you're into that sort of thing.\n\nFinally, even though they're not my preferred choice, the salads are pretty good options as well. Mangoberry salad, Thai mango chicken, and superfood delight are all salads that I've sampled here from friends or family.\n\nOops, almost forgot about dessert! Aside from the standard chocolate-covered strawberries, which are always great, they have many options for people with a sweet tooth. The creme brulee options are all nice, but my new favorite is a slice of chocolate heaven called the Sinful 7. It's rich, it's sweet, and it's chocolatey. I definitely need to share that with somebody next time because it's such a huge portion after a meal.\n\nOne thing I do miss from the Eastern Avenue location is that one or two of the regular employees definitely recognized me on my return visits, even as early as the second or the third time. Doesn't seem to be the case just yet on Sunset, but I'm so happy with the food and the location that we'll have plenty of time to warm up to each other.

I came on a business trip and each time we go to Vegas we try to experience a new hotel. When we arrived in our room there were disgusting greasy handprints on the headboard of each of our beds! GROOOOSSS right?????  Overall our room just felt dirty. There was what looked like dried up vomit in the bathroom next to the toilet paper. One word...disgusting. When we called to tell them about or room they just said they would send up housekeeping to assess it. When she got there even she was disgusted and sanitized both headboards completely. The shower constantly flooded so we would have a pool in the bathroom, who need rehab if you have your own personal pool in your room I guess. I would not recommend this to anyone. \nThe only positive was that our room did have a nice view of the strip and the pools were pretty.

I got star-struck by folks like LeVar Burton, Marina Sirtis, Brent Spiner, and Jonathan Frakes!  No Picard though this round :-(.  For a nominal fee you could get a pic and auto from each of them!  And these folks were friendly as ever.  Just passing by there were no divas in the house.  Hell, even the original SHAFT, Richard Roundtree was there! *Shut yo' mouth'\n\nLots of convention space and a number of dealers to get your Star Trek swag!  No joke, I bought no Star Trek swag, but scored big time with some Star WARS memorabilia I've been wanting for years.  And paid a pittance for them.  Ha Ha!  It was fun to roam around the hall and see what everyone was offering.  I've been meaning to get to this convention, thanks to Groupon I finally answered the calling!  Only a mere $10 to get in!  Wasn't all that bad considering it's held at the Rio Hotel & Casino every year, fun place to play, see some ladies in teeny bikinis!  Only this trip it was people in Star Trek cosplay, and a lot of folks wearing red shirts.  If you don't know Star Trek, a red shirt in an episode meant you were marked for death!  Later, sucka!\n\nNot the biggest convention I've been to (thanks to San Diego Comic Con) but definitely one of the funnest.  Trekkies and Trekkers (YES there is a difference) abounding everywhere!  After all the passerbys and the requited \""Live long and prosper' hand signal stuff, I was inside the inner sanctum!  It was cool just walking the convention floor and seeing all the amazing stuff I would probably never be able to afford.  Show-used prop phaser, anyone?\n\nBut this convention is about bringing Star Trek to the fans!  And there was a lot of seminars and shows abound.  The highlight of the day for me was witnessing THE SHAT William Shatner and Kate Mulgrew together!  Both Captain Kirk and Captain Janeway on one stage!  It was a great interview between the two, and they kept folks engaged by letting people in the entire hall audience ask any Star Trek related question they wanted.  Really great, great conversation.  \n\nI scored some great swag, learned some new things, and had a ton of nerd fun.  I will be back again, Star Trek Convention!

A simple sorry, to be followed by waiting in wet broken glass for 15 minutes until they took care of the situation. \n\nWe brushed that off and ordered our drinks. 20 minutes later we received our drinks and no interest in taking our food order. We had to ask the manager to have our order taken. 10 more minutes later, they began to take our order. Each time we wanted another drink, we had to flag down the waitress. She never proactively checked in on us at all. We waited... waited... for another 45 minutes until food arrived. \n\nThe food was ok. The margaritas were great! So great we asked for a larger glass for each serving. Each serving was in a 16 ounce-ish glass and the larger glass was more like 21 ounce. Not a double portion right? Remember this...\n\nWe decided after 3 hours of this service, we decided its time to go. Asked for the check and they brought it out on one. We asked them prior if separate checks were ok. We asked for the manager... apparently their cash registers can not handle separate checks past 12 people. This took rocket science apparently so the waitress gathered several people and begun doing backroom calculus to divide the check. It had to be that complex, because we waited for another HOUR for the check. That had to have been hard math!\n\nThe bills came finally... and those $12 margaritas asked to be in just a little larger glass came out to be $24 each!

I don't have the final bill yet, and fear I may join the growing list of Yelpers who were overcharged,  gouged, dinged, or otherwise have gotten a haircut as a result of Dollar's alleged business practices. \n\nMy preliminary review focuses on Dollar's customer service, or lack of it, in the wee hours of 29 January, 2014. It's 12:30 am and a group of ten tired, somewhat surly, travelers have queued up to pick up their reserved cars.\n\nI've heard in the line that since the customer service counters at Hertz, Avis, Thrifty, Enterprise, National, Fox, and Alamo were closed, their customers (who didn't belong to their frequent renter clubs) had to pick up their cars at Dollar. \n\nMany flights were arriving late into PHX due to the snowstorm dubbed \""Leon\"".\n\nTen customers, not all actual Dollar customers, were waiting in line to be served by one female employee, who clearly appeared as if she didn't want to be there. \n\nIt was taking her 10 minutes, on average,  to process each customer. I was sixth in line. There were eight computer terminals at the counter. One employee. \n\nThe Dollar Lady, as she will heretofore be known, would call out for someone named Alexis, (unforgettable because it sounded like she was ordering \""a Lexus\"" every time she picked up her two way radio) requesting a count on how many compact cars were available in the lot. It seemed as if Alexis was actually manufacturing these compact cars the Dollar Lady was ordering on the radio.\n\nWhen it was my turn to approach the Dollar Lady, she went through her spiel about insurance, which I declined, as my credit card and auto insurance at home covers me on hired or rented vehicles. We'll see if I get charged for the insurance,  as other Yelpers were.\n\nShe asked if I would be \""more comfortable\"" in a larger car. I don't know the reason for her question.

No yelling, no snottiness.  \n\nShe said something to me, I can't recall her exact words, owing to the time of day and my reflection upon what I said to her. I recalled her saying \""working here\"" and \""bathroom\"", but the rest was a bit of a blur. She instructed me to check boxes on the electronic contract screen. As I commenced to doing so, she got up and left. \n\nHad I offended her? The tension in the line of people behind me, now numbering at around a dozen, was palpable. Did she quit? Was she going to bring in more people?  Was she going to the lot to yell at Alexis? \n\nNope. Bathroom break.\n\nThe rest of the encounter between me and Dollar Lady was straightforward and civil in tone. I answered with \""yes\"" or \""no\"", bade her a pleasant evening, and headed down to the garage to see if Alexis had my car ready. \n\nI showed Alexis my contract. Alexis pointed towards the Focus. I got in and headed for the exit. Alexis was there again, in the booth. I handed him my contract and driver's license. He handed them back, opened the gates, and off I went...into the Phoenix night. Alexis went back, presumably to acquire more compact cars.\n\nWe'll see what happens when I'm handed the bill at the end of my rental agreement.\n\nOh, I'll be prepared, turning in the gas receipt \""from a station located within 10 miles of the rental location\"", as per the Dollar Lady's instructions.\n\nDon't mess with the Dollar Lady.  Especially at 1:00 in the morning. Replaced my watch battery and fixed the inside of another watch for $5 a piece. Super cheap considering the ones in the mall quoted me like $25+ to replace one battery. I was so impressed at how quick & nice the gentlemen was who works there.  He even added a diamond stud that had fallen out for free, so sweet.",2,concat

Getting a quick refund becomes an impossibility. It took a while but we finally got our $50 back. \n\nTwo hours of our vacation were wasted dealing with these scam artists. In case you're wondering, you need a passport to get into the FBR Open to prove your citizenship.  The U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service recently determined that tanned, plastic looking people have in fact taken over the TPC in Scottsdale on an annual basis only to defect to their ultra-lounge havens to hibernate until the following year. \n\nI'm really not sure what to think of this.  They speak English (but very faux surferish) and look American, but act completely juvenile, foolish and quite frankly, foreign.  Additionally, while waiting for the shuttle bus at Barcelona - ground zero for these immigrants, you can overhear the most ridiculous conversation.\n\nMost of these immigrants started drinking at the makeshift bar in the Barcelona parking lot. One woman talked of her plan to sacrifice her bra and panties on the 16th green in her effort to score Super Bowl tickets.  Another woman (while in the bus) rated men walking down Hayden as we drove by \""10!  You're a 9. You're more like a 7.  Ew, you're a 5.\""  The men were not to be outdone.  Who needs shuttle buses when you can just walk down Hayden, strip down to your bare, over-tanned chest while ladies driving by ask if you need a ride.\n\nIn a traditional immigrant mating call, women wore the most appropriate golf course attire they could find. On a cloudy 60 degree day many opted for mini skirts, tank tops, tacky fake Chanels, high heels and gawdy jewelry.  Men meanwhile chose over-gelled hair dos, flip flops or tube socks, shorts and Ed Hardy tees or golfy looking sweaters that they could spill their double-fisted beers all over.\n\nSuffice to say, that was a quick synopsis of some of the crowd at the FBR. Some people actually went to watch golf, enjoy a few $7 brews on a glorious winter afternoon in Scottsdale and watch the rowdiest, drunkest spectators in all of golf boo, jeer and hiss at the 16th hole.  Greenskeeper tix and Corporate Village tix are bonus if you can land them.\n\nThis event hasn't become a national attendance breaker on the PGA circuit for nothing.  FBR Open is to Phoenix as Mardi Gras is to New Orleans. Drunken debauchery. This event has come to embody Phoenix for better or worse and as a locally grown event, from its fledgling days at the Phoenix Country Club, that says a lot.  I have a good time every time I go -- plastic Scottsdale immigrants or not.  Five stars.",2,concat

Best thing about this place is the location and view from the bar, go to have a beer but eat somewhere else.  Can't recommend. We lived the cozy, busy little room. Despite the close tables we were comfy. And the people next to us were just friendly enough. My favorite dish was the salmon tartar. Just enough dill,  not oversauced, nutty and unexpected faro. Also excellent was the rabbit rillettes. So rich but also herbaceous and rustic. The Turkey leg was amazing. Could have used just a few more lovely little brussel sprouts.

Tried to place a pickup order, which had a few hiccups in itself. When we went to pick up, we got a very weird cold vibe, with the employees we dealt with not making eye contact or saying more than 2 words to us. After waiting a little too long to get our order that was already sitting on the counter, the guy opens each box and verbally confirms what we ordered. Getting home, one entire half of our order was actually just a big salad that we did not order...he definitely saw this. We called back and said we are coming back to get our chicken, will it be ready when we get there? Yes of course. Arrive back at Pio Pio and, just kidding, they are out of chicken (yeah right). Obviously angry at this point and asking for a refund, they said they didn't run the card so there's no need, when we earlier watched them run it and signed for it. We asked for some kind of proof of this, and they could provide none. Whether the charge shows up or not, we believe that they saw that the order was wrong, didn't feel like re-making anything at closing time, and sent us home knowing that. Why they told us to come back to the restaurant only to turn us away 5 minutes later I don't know. \n\nIt was nice know you, Pio Pio, but I'll just drive farther to get this kind of food from someplace that is run by people who give a crap from now on.

I called ahead, the receptionist was extremely friendly and said I could come down for a quick diagnostic test to see what's what. So I drove right down there. My first impression of this shop was off the charts great. The waiting room is bright, clean and spacious. The check-in was quick and painless. There's free WiFi with the secret code. Ask the receptionist. I barely had time to settle into a chair with my coffee when the technician came back with the results. The alternator was good but the battery was failing. Then came the best news you can hear from your mechanic: There's no charge today. Wait, that's my bad ear, did you say no charge? Yep, no charge for the diagnostic test and no unnecessary repairs suggested or completed. I' moved from know to like to trust in just one visit! Gab's is now my go-to auto mechanic for future needs.

I once stayed in a hostel in Cambodia and awoke to a rat gnawing gently at my face, and strangely this experience was not nearly as troubling as my experience at the HDP. \n\nUpon arrival you enter a cheery converted Victorian mansion tastefully done in muted pastels and with plenty of exposed refinished wood to greet you, and for a brief moment you feel that you may have found the best deal in Montreal-but then you are quickly \""relocated\"" to their other heritage building or 'D block\"" as we heard it lovingly referred to by a fellow traveller.\n\nWe were told that there was a \""problem\"" in our booking and that they were unable to accommodate the original terms of the booking, but that they had vacancy in their second heritage building and that essentially we had to accept this or could find other accommodation. Seeing that we were staying on a Saturday during the May long weekend, and had previously scoured the city for other vacancies we were not in a negotiating position.\n\nWe drove the short two minutes to the second building and couldn't find it.  We then saw a small sign indicating that we were in fact smack in front of it, but this couldn't be.  There was trash strewn in all directions at the entrance and the door that was supposed to be locked was flung open haphazardly.  After descending the few steps to our new subterranean chamber  we tentatively entered and were greeted with a pungent mix of body odour, hairspray and urine.  It was also suffocatingly humid and even the walls appeared to be sweating in revulsion.  We slithered our way to dorm \""K\"" where I was astonished to see what appeared to be an old cold storage room stacked with multiple rickety bunk beds.  Now to say that three people would have been comfortable in such a space would be fair, but twelve!  There was absolutely nowhere to store luggage-I ended up sleeping with my backpack and using it as a makeshift pillow, do to the fact that the provided pillow was caked with an indeterminable black dusting.  It was quickly noted that two of the four washrooms on the unit were out of order.  the third would quickly follow.  We calculated that there were approximately three washrooms for upwards of thirty people.  I made several calls to the front desk to alert them to the potential revolt that they would almost certainly have when fellow travellers would be returning from their nights of debauchery in Canada's sin city, yet despite this act of civic duty on my behalf no attempt was made to rectify the situation.  It wasn't until the following mid afternoon as we were preparing to check out that I saw a housekeeper gingerly approach with a mop and plunger in hand.  Evidently she knew what to expect, I certainly wish we did. \n\nNow it is important to stress that I do not have a personal vendetta or any ill will toward the HDP, I simply feel the strong need to make people aware that they should never ever consider staying here.\n\nIt baffles me that such a place continues to operate in a pseudo successful manner.  They must bank on the fact that those spending any time in HDP are so traumatized by their experiences that they vow to never speak of it again and hence don't spread the word that it should be avoided at all costs.  In writing this very lengthy review it was my vow to break this silence, and hope that it may deter others from spending their hard earned dollars here. Sweet Republic is seriously amazing.\n\nI have high standards for frozen dairy treats, and Sweet Republic is waaayy up there! \n\nI was drawn to this place after learning about their unique artisan ice cream flavors: Blue Cheese Honey, Sweet Corn, Real Mint, Maple Pecan ... plus housemade marshmallows - YUM!\n\nI was finally able to convince my hubby to make the pilgrimage because they are (incredibly) open until 11pm on Fridays and Saturdays, which makes it the perfect late night date spot :) \n\nThe shop is supercute, decor is contemporary and cheerful, with unique lighting fixtures. The tables are lined up along a banquette on the side of the restaurant - again, very date friendly! You can cozy up with your significant other while savoring some yummy icecreamy goodness. They have a stack of board games at the back of the restaurant, which I thought was a nice touch as well - how fun to get some delicious icecream while playing Connect Four with a friend?\n\nThe menu is excellent: from the icecreams themselves to the sundae options and awesome toppings, you really can't go wrong.\n\nI went in expecting to order the Campfire S'More Sundae, but made a rogue move at the last moment and switched over to the Pecan Turtle Sundae in a waffle cup... omgoodness, so, so GREAT. Before settling on my sundae, I did get a quick sample of the Plum Verbena icecream and wow - light, refreshing, and unique - definitely a good pick if you're in the mood for a scoop or two. \n\nNow, back to the Pecan Turtle Sundae: I've had lots of Turtle Sundaes and this one was just head and shoulders above anything else I've ever tasted. I seriously dreamed about it from the time I left Sweet Republic until the following weekend, when we returned so that I could have it again (and share it with my Grandmother, who is a fellow appreciator of a good frozen treat!) \n\nThe sundae is topped with hot fudge and salted caramel sauce, fresh whipped cream, and pecans that are toasted/transformed into little nuggets of greatness. The waffle bowl was the crowning glory: sweet, crispy, crunchy and delicious - be sure to get one :) \n\nMy husband ordered the Cookie Mintifesto and he loved it, although I wasn't a huge fan of the \""real\"" mint - I prefer fake mint, I guess :) It was pretty \""brisk\"" and not very sweet. \n\nMy son tried the Honey Blue Cheese on our second visit and was smacking his lips and \""mmm-mmm\""ing the whole time. \n\nService was alright - the sundaes take a bit of time to make and when they're busy, the employees seem stressed. \n\nI can't recommend Sweet Republic enough as a must-try destination in itself, but it will also become an \""anytime\"" place that you'll find yourself headed to every opportunity you have.",2,concat

There was no fine print to tell us that the huge menu here (mentioned by many other reviewers) becomes strictly limited for groupon customers (I've stopped buying groupons):  entrees were salmon, or chicken, or filet mignon. The shared appetizer list was equally short, diners next to us could choose carpaccio amongst other things, we could get mussels, or shrimp in garlic sauce or some kind of pepper with cheese in it. The shrimp in garlic was overcooked, not very tasty, dry. We had the steak, ordered it medium rare. It came medium well to well done in parts. I pointed this out to the waiter, saying I just want to have somebody agree with me that this is not medium rare. It is not, he agreed, and offered me another. No I said, I don't waste food, I just want somebody to see what I see and point it out to the boss and the chef in the hopes that things will improve. We saw him speaking to the patron, who ultimately brought back our credit card and receipt at the end of the meal. He thanked us for visiting his restaurant and that was it. So I said, apparently your chef doesn't know the difference between medium rare and medium well. Patron expressed his surprise with a very sorrowful face, and asked:  So your's was not done right? Now that was the main thing. If that was the first he had heard of it, he could have made some kind of response, offered some kind of comp, anything. I wouldn't have taken it, but would have liked a better response. Since we were convinced our waiter had told him, his response seemed disingenuous at best.

We were seated almost right away though. \n\nService got a little better. Our waitress was sweet and she kindly got us whatever we needed. Food was still whatever. I've had better Chinese food. Their soup was bland. We had to add a little bit more salt just to get the perfect taste it needed. Eggs Benedict was horrible. That too was blind. They used to have crab legs for brunch, but there wasn't any of that anymore. The shrimp was.. rotten. There was black stuff on it and I didn't know what it was until it was too late and already in my digestive system. I think I actually got food poisoning or something from that because I've been going nonstop to the restroom since then. \n\nSunday was the last and final day that my family and I will ever pay attention to this buffet.

It seems like the problem has been addressed before but the owners seems to like the way his business is running so I have decided to place my findings here to warn other people eating..  Don't really care if you take my advice or not just be careful here I bought a Groupon for Guru Palace a few weeks ago and just used it this evening, boy am I glad that I did!  The food was delicious, the service was quick and efficient AND really friendly, and did I mention that the food was delicious?\n\nFirst thing is first, the food was incredible.  My companion and I ordered the Samosa appetizer, Garlic Naan, Lamb Korma, and Chicken Tikka Masala.  I also had an Indian Tea (Chai) which was perfectly spiced.  The Samosa was amazing, the filling was moist and flavorful and the crust was delicate and flaky.  There was just the slightest hint of sweetness to the filling that really perfected the dish.  The Garlic Naan is the best that I've ever had!  I think I could happily make a meal of just the Garlic Naan and not regret it. The Lamb Korma was also amazing, the lamb was tender and flavorful and the sauce was rich and thick.  The Chicken Tikka Masala (a staple in my life) was to die for!  The chicken was super tender and swimming in amazing, thick, rich sauce.  The spice level was perfect in all the dishes- the server asked us on a scale of 1-10 how spicy we wanted our dishes and we ordered a 7.  I can honestly find no fault with any of the dishes I sampled!\n\nThe service is really great as well.  I was meeting my companion at the restaurant and I was the first to arrive; the staff greeted me promptly and made sure that I was comfortable while I waited.  As soon as my dinner companion arrived, we were seated and served water and complimentary Papadum with a delicious chutney.  I really liked our server (and all the other staff members that spoke to us), he was efficient and friendly, and happily recommended his favorite Samosa variety when we expressed interest.  During our meal, three different people (one being the owner I believe) stopped by to make sure that everything was good and that we were pleased with our meal and service.  I appreciated the attention, which felt genuine and was not at all bothersome. \n\nThe atmosphere in the restaurant was also wonderful.  It is not a large place, but the tables are all well spaced, and the entire place is impeccably decorated.  There is a lot of art on the walls, ambient lighting, soft music, and well dressed staff.  Though it is still a casual restaurant, it's also nice enough to feel really good about taking a date there. \n\nI really enjoyed my meal and service at Guru Palace and I will definitely be returning soon!",2,concat

3.6981589794158936,3.56888747215271,3.947105884552002,"EDIT! So right after I wrote this review/essay, two 5 star reviews caught my eye, one written on 9/13 by michael e. and the other written on 9/14 by john h.  Both of these people have only written 3 reviews, all in the same day and all for hotels owned by The Siegel Group. You have got to be kidding me! On 9/13 and 9/14, I was staying at Rumor!  This is deceptive and insulting. A better star rating isn't going to fix your business. Instead of inventing fake people to rave about your fabulous properties, take that time to fix some shit. Writing fake reviews is the least productive thing you (whoever you are) should be doing right now. Knock it off, get your shit together and run your business. FLAGGED x2! \n\nEchoing the sentiment of at least one other reviewer. I REALLY wanted to like this place. The week they opened (about a year ago), they hosted a small cocktail party for a non-profit organization I am involved in... this was cool. A year later, my girlfriend and I decided to give Rumor a try despite the very (suspicious) mixed bag of reviews. I am sorry to report that our experience reflected most of the bad reviews and very little of the fabulousness described.\n\n1. 3 days before we left, I called the front desk to ask about the availability of the soaking tubs. Our email said they were avail. based on availability/per request. The girl on the phone told me that there was no way to request them. She did not offer any other solution and the call ended awkwardly. Our confirmation also mentioned that you can email questions to the manager. We sent that email. See #7 for the outcome.\n\n2. When we arrived at the hotel we were met by a very friendly valet and a helpful, professional girl (Toni) at the front desk. She was surprised and confused by the info i was given over the phone. She said that the hotel was less than 10% booked and it would have been no problem to block us out a room with a tub.  \n\n3. The Room- I knew that this hotel was for party people. I was prepared for things to be a little worn and rough, but I was bummed that it was actually DIRTY. The bed, couch and bathroom counter were clean but almost every other surface was not. \n- Distractingly strong odor. Sour and smoky despite being a non-smoking room. -Soaking tub had hair by the drain and soap film all over- Side table with removable glass top had filth under the glass \n- Tile shower was filmy - Bathroom sink also had a hair in it\nAfter a long drive from LA, we just wanted to get our vacation started. We decided that instead of being moved to another room, we would suck it up. We decided to just use clorox wipes on everything (we had planned to do it anyway). \n\n4. Dinner- Food was reasonable and we saw the Sun-Thu happy hour on the website. Victor was our waiter (he was great). I ordered a cocktail and the bartender poured it in a plastic ribbed water glass (like the kind Mc Donald's gives you when you ask for water). I asked what was up with the cup. Do I get a plastic cup because it was happy hour? Victor reluctantly informed us that it actually wasn't happy hour. The Manager reserves the right to cancel it at any time. The website says that holidays and events are excluded from happy hour. This Sunday was neither. $9 jack and coke in a bathroom water cup, just because! Food was good, but it didn't matter. The combination disappearing happy hour/lame bartender was a buzz kill. \n\n6. Breakfast- The next morning, we ordered room service and again the food was good, but aside from the oatmeal (served in a real bowl), the waffle and fruit plate were served on flimsy cafeteria-style styrofoam plates. We were told that they were out of to-go containers and they were sorry about the plates. This breakfast was $50. We were not at a taco truck.  REAL PLATES! REAL CUPS! \n\n8. Relaxing by the pool- Being the only people in the pool was great, but the bar at the pool was still not clean since its last use. Trash on the bar, dirty, white vinyl pool furniture. \n\n7. END OF OUR ROPE- After an evening out we came back to an email response from the manager. In addition to the soaking tub question, we had asked about the \""No outside food or drink\"" policy we had read about on Yelp. The manager responded with \"" We have the no outside food or drink policy for insurance reasons. We can not be responsible for anything you bring in\"". WHAT!? Your insurance says that a guest can not bring a bag of Ruffles into their room? A liability? I think not. We immediately showed this email to the girl at the front desk and she said that they do not have that policy anymore. She was very nice and helped us end our stay. \nThis place has been through 8 managers and it shows.  I am sorry Rumor, you are not too fabulous or exclusive to not be clean or consistent. You expect flexibility from your guests but offer very little yourself. Get your staff on the same page and the hair out of your tubs. Otherwise, hourly rates might be more appropriate. I have been here a few times and each time has been great! I LOVE their beer and the food is good too! This is a great place to hangout after work, watch the game, or just relax. I love going here.. I try to bring anyone who visits me to this place! \n\nThey have a pretty decent happy hour.

When we asked where our other four orders were, the server was very defensive - \""sorry about the wait, but a bunch of other people just left and cancelled their orders, so we had to deal with that.\""  (Wow, can't imagine why that happened!)  At that point, we decided that we needed to leave without the food, because our conference sessions were about to begin.  To his credit, the bartender said he wouldn't charge us for the drinks.

It really does feel like you're drinking in a wood-paneled tavern in Northern Wisco!  Nonetheless, it's a hip place with lot's of cool people and great beers.  The day we were there a guy was cooking up 40lbs of free ribs!!  I wasn't expecting much, but they were some of the best ribs i've ever had...they were a weird fusion onf jamaican/Indian/Brazilian.

We had the regional tasting that featured Tuscan cuisine along with the wine pairing ($75). The waiter Jered added much to the overall dining experience, as he elaborately described the history/culture surrounding each dish and described the wine notes and rationale for each pairing. The wines were excellently paired with each dish and portions were reasonable. Courses came at a very leisure pace, which we enjoyed - dinner lasted 2 hours. Price of dinner was just under $400 for the two of us (tip not included)...yes, pricey but quite honestly, the best fine dining experience we've ever had, and for that, the dinner was well worth it! I wouldn't recommend this for the casual diner or even those looking for only a romantic setting, but for true foodies that love wine pairings at its finest, I definitely recommend B&B Ristorante!",2,concat

The selection here was limited compared to other chinese buffets I have been to, and what they did have was low quality and low on taste.  The pork was chewy and seemed old, I spit it out after taking a bite.  I don't know how one makes teriyaki chicken taste bad, but they were sure successful here because the sause was greasy and the chicken chewy (probably low quality meat).  The sweet and sour sauce tasted weird, and the hot mustard was not hot and seemed watery.  I only ate some of the chow mein and fried rice, both of which wasn't great either.  \n\nI am not quite sure how this place is in business, with the quality of the food.   I did not try any dinner menu items - so I will withhold judgment, though I will never return to find out for sure.

The tuna was in a nice sweet sauce that ended with a spicy finish.  We also tried the Sushi (Rainbow roll) which was also fresh and exceeded my expectations.  We didn't try any Sake, though their menu claims to have the largest selection of sake on this side of the Pacific, but my martini, made with Japanese alcohol, was excellent.\n\nI also enjoyed the atmosphere.

They give you a good portion of rice, mixed with veggies and shredded chicken. It's seriously so good. Even kids will probably like it.

Our waitress, a very young girl recently from NJ, seemed to have never served anyone before and had never looked at the menu, it seemed. We vainly asked for some sparkling water, some mineral water, some Pellegrino....she asked \""is that wine?\"" Huh? \n\nShe did come back carrying 2 small bottles of San Benedetto. First hurdle overcome. She had never opened a wine bottle either, the fianc\u00e9 had to do it. The antipasto and linguine with white clam sauce were passable, although some salami had been around longer than I would keep in my fridge. After essentially waiting on ourselves and making requests that were clearly foreign to this young lady, the real clincher was when at 10 pm, the whole place began filling with smoke. The kitchen staff was apparently burning the day's grime off the ovens and as one fellow told the fianc\u00e9 \""the hoods don't work\"". No kidding. We quickly poured the last of our wine into our glasses and literally ran for the front door. There is no exaggeration here. They smoked us out.

We went with a classic Bacon Cheeseburger and the Hangover. Each comes with fries or sweet potato tots. Also you choose your own bun which is a nice touch (pretzel bun is worth a try). They also have tons of different sauces which they give to you on the side. The burgers are cooked well and the taste of the burgers is not overwhelmed by over-the-top sauces or seasonings. \n\nImpressed with Rehab as a whole and will definitely be back for more burger in the future.",2,concat

The service is friendly.  The food is fantastic.  The hot-chocolate is the best I've had since I've moved here.  Free wi-fi, and nice spacious windows to look out to the street when you're looking for a little break/distraction from your work.  What more could you really ask for?  And like others, I am a bit hesitant to hype this place since it is so awesome.",2,concat

First Place went to my father who cut my hair with a bowl on my head.  \n\nI asked that my hair be cut to leave it full both around the sides and on top.  The result was short on the sides with the left side being significantly shorter than the left.  The top was cut somewhat longer, but doesn't blend well with the sides.  Even the 30 second haircut I got in the Marine Corps was better than this cut.  At least the Marine barber cut it evenly all around.  \n\nThe barber took two phone calls on his cell phone while cutting my hair.  He was minimally courteous.  The price on their website is $13, but when I asked how much the haircut was I was told $15.  Not a very professional shop.  I wonder if all the great reviews were written by friends and relatives.

We were forced to stay here with son's hockey team and even for one night it is AWFUL!!!!!!  Spoke to the manager and he ignored me and said I am only one who complained of the stench.

Verona Chophouse is definitely OUT after my third visit for dinner last night!  I'm sad to say that, but 2 bad visits of 3 visits ends in NO WAY will I return again.  So, as a frequent visitor to Lone Butte Casino and Wild Horse Pass, they are kind enough to give me perks to come back to the casino (imagine that!).  One of the perks I get each month is $100 or so to spend on restaurants/food in the casino.  So, my fiancee and I decided to head out to Verona Chophouse a few different times, which I'll summarize here with the approx dates and experience we had on the 3 visits.  \n\n1st visit - Went for dinner.  Food was so-so.  Service was horrible (soooo slow) and atmosphere was nothing to comment on.\n\n2nd visit - June 2011  Food was REALLY good.  Had the filet mignon and my fiancee had the chicken parm.  Both were tasty.  The filet was juicy and soooo tender.  Chicken parm was a large portion and delicious.  Service was better than 1st visit (not spectacular, but not bad...) and we were given new hope that this could be a great place for us to eat, near home.  Also, there was a piano player and a singer there for a great ambience.\n\n3rd visit - Aug 2011  Went at 6PM and asked for a table for two.  Was told by the hostess that there was a 20 min wait.  No problem.  More gambling!  We came back 20 min later and were quickly seated, with the hostess telling us the waitress was REALLY busy delivering some food and other things and would be a few min.  About 5 minutes later, while reviewing the menu, the water/buser guy comes by to ask what we want to drink and tells us the waitress is delayed and very busy.  Next up the manager comes by to tell us the same thing.  Um, now we are getting worried and looking around to discover how there was a 20 min wait when the place is empty??!  There were a total of 8 tables with customers and the rest empty.  We chalked it up to it must be they don't have enough servers.  We finally meet our poor waitress.  She was a bit on edge and stressed and I kinda felt bad for her.  At a few times I actually saw her RUNNING through the restaurant to get to the back and run a credit card, pick up food, etc.  So, we ordered fried mozzarella and crab stuffed mushrooms as appetizers.  I ordered the filet again because the 2nd visit here it was so yummy!  My fiancee ordered penne pasta with chicken and broccoli, but asked for no broccoli.  We wait about 10 min and then our waitress comes by to ask if we want our salads first because the mushrooms take longer to cook.  We said that's fine and so shortly after that, we got our salads (I had the house salad, fiancee had the ceasar).  Both salads were pretty tasty and probably the best part of the meal.  Appetizers come out 10-15 min later.  The mushrooms were not fully cooked and were nothing special.  I really think they were frozen pre-bought from Costco that they baked in the oven.  My fiancee said the fried mozzarella tasted like fish, but I didn't taste any, so not sure.  Maybe they used a fish fryer for them?  Waiting..waiting...waiting for food.  Meanwhile, another table of 2 gets seated in our waitresses section.  She keeps walking by to serve them and telling us that it will be just a little longer as they are waiting on the filet.  About 10 min later (now about an hour into dinner...way too long for this dead place!) our food entrees arrive.  Looks like my fiancees meal is the wrong order and she confirms it is!  She did admit it was her own error and she put in the wrong order.  So now he's left returning his entree to wait another 10+ minutes for the correct entree.  Meanwhile, I'm anxiously awaiting my first bit of filet.  Blech.  It was overcharred on one side (which the chef hid by placing that side on the plate so you couldn't see it!) and had no flavor.  The broccolini was cold and what were supposed to be potato fingerlings appeared to be rocks.  Seriously.  Now she brings out the correct entree for my fiancee.  We know that the check is going to take 30 min for her to produce, given our experience thus far, so we ask for the check and tell her we are using the casino vouchers I get, as a perk.  She comes back about 10 min later and says she needs to check on something with the vouchers and should just be a minute.  10 more min later the manager (who was doing NOTHING but yelling at everyone during this whole dining experience...shouldn't she be running food and actually helping them??!!) came by to see if we needed anything.  Luckily, we didn't answer what we wanted to say!!  Told her we needed the vouchers done so we could leave.  Said it will be just another min.  The waitress returns 3-4 min later and says we're good to go.  THANK GAWD!! \n\nSo, third time was not a charm and neither is Verona Chophouse.  Even if it's FREE (like our meal was) it's not worth the time or effort!  Keep gambling but don't eat here. They accept Culinary Health Fund insurance.  A huge plus in Vegas/Henderson.\n\nI called on a Tues morning at 9am when they opened.  I was able to get an appt. for the same day at 1pm.  I arrived 15 min early as requested.  While I was filling out the paperwork (a small amount), another patient arrived.  He signed in and was seen withing 5 min.  After finishing my paperwork, I was also seen within 5 min.  I was first seen by the assistant who took digital Xrays.  They were quick and harmless.  She explained a couple things and then I had to wait less than 10 min to see Dr. Eric Lac.  In the meantime they gave me the remote to the tv and actually had expanded cable channels (not movie).  Dr Lac came in and asked some questions, explained some things, examined my teeth then gave them a deep cleaning.  The deep cleaning was simple and painless.  I used to hate this and I had to make an effort to not tense up once I realized this was painless.  After Dr. Lac, the assistant came back in and polished my teeth, also simple and painless.  They gave me a goodie bag and scheduled me for 6 months.\n\nImportant details for me personally.  First, I couldn't tell if anyone smoked or not.  I absolutely hate when someone is working close to my face with their face and I have to smell their dying cigarette lungs breathing 5 inches from me.  And the assistant and Dr Lac didn't have foul breathe.  Also really important when visiting a dentist.  Second, the wait time where minimal.  Finally, the staff was pleasant and visit was comfortable.\n\nI do recommend this dentist.  I'll be back in 6 months.",2,concat

My husband and I stayed there last year for the 4th time (previous three times were pleasant enough, but there was different staff working there - a young woman) and were greeted by the font desk worker who said \""why would you want to vacation in Montreal, why not go somewhere warm\"" - ummm ok, way to promote your city?\n\nOur key card reader did not work on our door because the battery was dead, they did not have another room but put us temporarily in a room that had not been cleaned yet, it was kind of awkward. After the worker finally tracked down the owner he was able to finally manually get the door open with an actual key. The locksmith was not able to come out an repair it until later the next day apparently so if my husband or I needed to leave the room one person needed to remain. My husband went down to get us breakfast (the breakfast sucks there) the next morning while I stayed in the room, we ate in the room, but eventually we were ready to start our day and head out. I asked the front desk (a different worker there when we checked in the night before) how we can get in and out of our room throughout the day/after we return from our Montreal excursions they gave us a key, we tested it ad it worked. OK that's fine right?\n\nI get a call on my cell phone that afternoon/early evening saying they need the key they gave me to unlock someone else's room since the same thing happened to their key card reader, I let them know I was on my way back anyways and will be there soon. After I hung up I realized how confusing and weird that was: 1. they don't have another key to open this person door and 2. probably the most alarming thing, they gave us the master key\n\nWhen I got back to the hotel (it was the same front desk person that checked us in, a bitter little unhappy man living in a small unhappy world) I expressed my concern that the hotel gave us the master key, I don't feel safe with my items in the room, do they do that often, what if they give the key to someone else and they get into my room (my computer was in there) - he proceeded to flip out and tell me it was not the master key, and that he's going to kick us out and not refund our money and he doesn't care if we ever come back and it's not his problem. I told him fine I'm going to get my stuff and getting out of here since he was literally screaming at us and I was scared about what he'd do next.\n\nHe followed us upstairs where I called his bluff and said if this isn't the master key than it won't work when I try it in the neighboring door, when I went to try it he grabbed my hand and the key ad kept screaming at me, he opened our room shoved us inside and said get your stuff and leave or stay I don't care. Needless to say we left, but not before calling the police (who couldn't do anything about it). I was appalled that someone in customer service would treat a customer like that, swearing, yelling, and getting physical with them.\n\nThe hotel itself isn't anything great, and is certainly not worth the low cost.

Lots and lots of TV's for those sports fans, but they also play non-sports shows too for people like me to be entertained by :) They even have individual TV's at each booth!

The owner walked past me, one of the bartenders, got my wristband from the guy at the door and paid another guy my cover and not one of them said a word about not being able to wear a hat. Right after I paid my cover an employee hassled me about it. Demanded my money back and left. Won't be back. I also used to like Images but reconsidering my patronage there as well since it has the same owner. FIrst let me mention that I am a Chicago native and this means I know pizza.  This place serves the closest to Chicago style deep dish pizza I have found since leaving home.  (closer to Uno's and Connies than Giorgano's but we will take it). This could be because their other locations are all in Illinois. They also serve thin (sliced correctly, in squares), double crust, pan, and stuffed.  Upon being seated, the table receives (free) a basket of the most delightful garlic parmesan bread bites we have ever tasted.  These, plus a salad, would be enough for a normal person's dinner.  But no, get the pizza and take it home.  A medium deep dish will feed your house for the next few days, and warms up as delicious as first served.  Sadly, filling up on the bread and anticipating a pizza meal was not enough for us.  We also ordered the cheesy bacon fries.  We were overstuffed but not sorry.  These feature real bacon, two cheeses and dipping sauce.  We have never, ever, had fries this good.\nThe restaurant is cute and comfortable with Italian country decor, but a bit small.  A large party with children came in when we were in mid meal and we were asked to move to a booth so they could push all the tables on one side of the room together. We did not mind moving, unfortunately the large party with children in the small space subjected us to learning much more about the lives and activities of them and their children than we ever wanted or needed to know. Size feels like a real restaurant in Italy without the outdoor seating.They provide linen napkins but no tablecloths.  The staff provided regular check-ins to see if we needed anything, refilled beverages without being asked and the food was served promptly. The server was extremely patient with an elderly foursome who did not understand their check or how to use an entertainment coupon (close quarters, we heard it all clearly).\nIn summary, I would gladly chance the possibility of loud families in close quarters to feast on those delightful bread bites and the great pizza.",2,concat

Tom's is the same.  Usually the ambiance is booths and plain tables-and-chairs.  Often you order at a counter and they bring you the food.  Tom's is the same.  Prices are usually a bit more than fast food but not as much as regular sit-down restaurants.  You guessed it - Tom's is the same.\n\nBut this Tom's has a problem.  Consider the brisket platter for about $10, which consists of brisket, a biscut, and a side.  What could be so bad?  Well, it was the brisket.  The portion consisted of about 3 ounces (maybe 4) of meat utterly covered in a sweet BBQ sauce -- not cooked with the sauce, just inundated with it.  Ok - scrape it off, you will suggest.  So I did.  What was underneath was small slices entirely from the fatty part of the brisket.  Half of my small portion of meat was fat, and not crispy tasty fat but soggy discouraging muck.  The pictures on the wall showed lots of lean slices from the first cut of the brisket -- misleading? or downright fraudulent?  Now I see why they put 6 ounces of BBQ sauce on 3 ounces of meat.\n\nI notice that the rest of our group of six was eating their food, mostly, but without any outward signs of real pleasure.  That at least was comforting - misery loves company. I go here all the time!! Super nice owners! Most importantly the food is AMAZING!!!

Our order came and his steak was well done.  I noticed the girl at the other table had a long, thin steak and it was medium rare although she ordered well done. Both tables sent back the steaks (after our waitress confirmed our order as if we said it wrong) and moments later new steaks came out, only they were the same ones delivered to the correct tables, meaning my husband got the other girl's steak. As Kathy placed the steak down, she said the chefs cut into the side (over a 2 inch cut) to confirm the temp. My husband and I both looked at each other in shock!  This is a health code violation to place food on a table, then reserve it to someone else. Our waitress kept eyeing us because she knew we knew what she did and after she asked if anything was wrong, she argued that both steaks were in the window. We said we don't want it and she said I'll remake it. \n\nNeedless to say, we are beyond shocked with the professionalism of our waitress and the level of service this place conducts.

When I called her to confirm that I was buying the correct product, I greeted her with a 'hi, how are you', she mumbled 'hey'. I can't help I have manners.); when I arrived at the salon, every beautician simply looked at me, no greeting or anything (this put me in a foul mood); she told me that we would have been done sooner if I had flat ironed my hair as her page has all of the instructions; my hair is coming undone (she said she braids an inch past the real hair - not so in my case); the braids in the top middle of my head are sectioned into larger pieces when compared to other sections (a rip off).\n\nLastly, I'm not happy with this synthetic hair. I have to flat iron it everyday and this takes way too much time. She didn't tell me I'd have to maintain the hair until she was finished braiding it. If I had known this I would have bought the packaged 'human hair.'\n\nI would not recommend Braids by Sean. Now this is what a suite should look like! I took my mom & sisters to Vegas over the weekend for my mom's birthday. We each got a suite ranging from the 49th floor to the 59th floor. Needless to say our views were nothing but breathtaking. The suites were gigantic in size - dare I say, bigger than my apartment/condo! Each suite has a full kitchen, living room, an actual bedROOM, massive master bathroom, and another full bath outside. You read that right, two FULL baths! In the master bathroom - which could've double as a ball room; seriously, you can hold a dance in there as it's very spacious - there's a his and hers sink (are there any other kind of sinks?), a tub with a large window overlooking the strip, and a shower stand that could've fit a party of four (it is vegas after all)!\n\nThere are a few minor issues (albeit trivial) I had with the room, such as: bedroom door slamming continuously whenever the AC was on, old fashioned curtains that wouldn't close properly leaving the bright sunlight to shine through, and lastly, the dim lighting. The windows are darkly tinted and the light fixtures are opaque enough to drown out the lights, giving off a yellow hue. Ladies, it's difficult putting on your makeup when there's an instagram-style filter in the room. Thankfully these issues are so trivial that it's not enough for me to knock off a full point from this review. \n\nThe price was reasonable despite a huge boxing fight going on that weekend so it should be very affordable off-season.

This was after I made a 1 year commitment.  \n\nThe internet was very flakey.  Over the 1 year I spent as a customer, the internet went down on average about once a month.  Almost every time I called there was an automated message informing me that my area was being upgraded and I should expect internet outages.  Do they really expect me to believe they did major upgrades that many times in a single year, and really they just can't keep their network from crumbling on a monthly basis?

I asked the service representative if such a charge is approved with the public utilities commission.  She said that it is, but I think i'm going to contact them anyway to make sure before I pay the bill.  They really have the nerve to charge me $17.32 to turn off my service?!?!?!

We booked two double-bed rooms over the phone. We were really excited about staying at this new hotel. We had heard that it was beautiful and lively. They gave us great customer service when we called. It sounded so awesome that even my brother and his family wanted to go! They asked if I can call and book one more room.\n\nSo I called and asked to try and see if we can book one more double-bed room. They said they were more than happy to book one more double-bed room! We just had to pay an extra 30$. Great. \""Will the rooms be close to each other?\"" No because the other two rooms are single-bed rooms. Hmmm...that's not what we booked and what the sales girl told me. So they told me that I had to pay an extra 30$ per room for the double bed. Fine. I'll pay it but I am not happy that I was misled to begin with. I want to talk to the girl who gave me the wrong information or her supervisor to file a complaint. If I hadn't called back and added the additional room I would have showed up with 8 adults and 1 infant with two beds only?\n\nWell, nobody ever called me back. Whatever.

Bussers run there ass off and servers seem to do nothing. Took forever for are food to get there and when it did it was cold. When I complained to the manager he barely spoke English. Anyways if you looking for great Mexican food look elsewhere. A beautiful restaurant with a view to kill for, perfect food, and perfect service.  Alright!  See you next review!\n\nWell, OK.  I guess my paltry review might be interesting to someone (probably not), but here goes.\n\nThe interior is gorgeous.  The artwork, the decor, everything.  Everyone greets you warmly and with a smile.  No stuffiness at all, it's all very warm and inviting.  We sat outside and, except for an occasional mist of water and ducks trying to get in on our dinner, it was perfect.  The fountains look majestic from this side, illuminated by Paris and Planet Hollywood.\n\nOur waiter was delightful.  Very entertaining, friendly, warm, knowledgeable and attentive.  All of the wait staff was top notch.  The sommelier was amazing and rightfully proud of the pairings he selected.  These were, by far and away, the best wine pairings I've ever had.  It seems like the chef and the sommelier designed their menus together, because the food and the wine perfectly compliment each other.  I mean REALLY compliment.  Not in terms of vague overtones, or mouthfeel, or anything terribly abstract.  The wines TASTED like they belonged right alongside the dishes; like they would be incomplete without each other.  Amazing.  If you do the tasting menu and don't get wine pairings you're doing it wrong.\n\nThe first course was the Maine Lobster Salad.  More lobster than salad, which is fine with me.  The succulent, sweet lobster is molded and topped with kind of like a micro-greens salad.  The apple and champagne vinaigrette gave a nice acidity which cut through the richness of the lobster.  Complimenting the dish are pink peppercorns which explode with the absolute perfect flavor (that is also present in the accompanying wine!!!)  and tiny balls of avocado and cantaloupe which give the lobster a creamy companion to contrast with the sharpness of the vinegar.\n\nNext was the scallop.  Personally the biggest scallop I'd ever seen.  Seared beautifully with a nice brown crust.  The scallop was so tender, even on the bed of light, creamy mousseline, it seemed like it couldn't even support it's own weight.  Sweet and succulent doesn't even describe the scallop, and the veal jus was a surprisingly good accompaniment.  This was my wife's favorite dish of the evening.\n\nAnd then, the foie gras.  The duck liver is just perfectly cooked: impeccably seared on the outside, with just enough heat in the middle to just soften the fat enough so that it literally (really, literally) melts in your mouth.  Accompanied by a rhubarb reduction of a sweet Hungarian wine, which is served as the pairing.  The sommelier recommended alternating every bite.  He was right.  Incredible.\n\nI had the lamb with pisto, mint, and and a tempura zucchini flower.  The dish is just beautiful.  I almost didn't want to eat it, it was an amazing work of art.  But I did.  It was good.  Really, really good.  Lamb, surprise, was cooked perfectly.  The pisto was a perfect accompaniment, and the mint was great and not overpowering.\n\nDesert was definitely the most artistic looking course.  Beautifully presented, and delicious on top.  I opted for the one with the mini cinnamon buns.  Not too sweet and a great balance of flavors.\n\nObviously I could have ended this review in one line.  What's the point?  Of course everything was amazing.  But one line wouldn't do this restaurant justice for how perfect everything is.",2,concat

The food, though, is very low quality (i.e. meatballs at the Italian station were previously frozen and still cold, the Mexican station made Taco Bell look gourmet, and the cookies at the dessert station looked like they came out of a plastic container purchased at Albertsons). The taste of the food was substandard as well.  It was bland, processed, over cooked, and sad.

The calamari was so stringy that I had to swallow it in one bite because I couldn't separate it with my teeth.  The egg rolls were at least crispy and well-rolled, but they had absolutely no seasoning other than a tad too much salt.  The shrimp were overcooked, the barbecue pork was dry, and the hot dumplings were cold and under seasoned.\n\nThen came the entrees.  I ordered Imperial Chicken, thinking that being the restaurant's namesake, it had to be good.  I was wrong.  The breading was mushy, the chicken was dry, and the sauce was basically  sweet and sour sauce with added hoisan, and several dried peppers that were burnt so badly they added an unintentional, overdone smoky flavor.\n\nMy boyfriend ordered the Ma-po Tofu.  He loves spicy food, and this was just a little spicy, but the spice overpowered all the other flavors in the dish (besides the scallions).

I had to ask several times for a glass of water.  The waitress came by with the water pitcher and had just enough to fill my glass up halfway, so she returned to the kitchen for a refill and stopped by to fill my boyfriend's glass.  By this time, I drank my half glass of water - and she didn't even bother to top mine off.  I tried to ask for some, but she walked away.  \n\nPlus, I thought it was supposed to be an authentic Chinese food restaurant - what's with the Vivaldi and Mozart soundtrack?\n\nSkip this place all together and hit up the Asian grocery and gas station next door.

The lamb chap and all the tapas dishes we tried were tasty, creative and all a little different.

Four of those six companies quoted comparably.\n\nSo what made me go with Impact?

My Irish nuts and berries ( a cream chamboard drink) was so strong it made my head spin (in a good way). Very expensive, but very much worth it.",2,concat

I have had a lot of good meat from here but it seems they have lost touch with why they have done well; customer service  and integrity. \n\nI went to get some ribeye today to make some Korean food and asked if they could slice it for me. They said they would need to freeze it before they could slice it. Understandable but the attitude I got was not deserved. I believe the comment was \""you should have called me this morning\"". I didn't mind coming back so I was told two hours. I was cool with that. After I left my wife told me to just buy the meat and she would freeze it a cut it herself. When I went back to get the meat the two prices I selected somehow became three. After looking at the meat they switched out a prime cut I picked for two extremely fatty brown (closed to spoiled meat). Classic bait and switch. \n\nThey should know that people have choices and social media is a tool that can hurt business. Think twice about trusting them and taking their word.

Dr. Gus has put together one of the most impressive veterinary teams with a broad scope of skills and expertise that I have ever experienced. Dr. Koch is responsible for Saving my very small poodle who was severely injured by someone who abused her. Not only did he save her but he along with his staff supported us over a year long process to bring the abuser to justice, providing letters to the court, copies of medical documents on several occasions. The actions of every staff member in this hospital were not only a display of impeccable professionalism and care of the highest quality but a display of their true commitment to caring for animals. The patients that go to this clinic receive the best care possible and I suspect are cared for as well if not better than human patients in some clinics. \n\nI am committed 100% to this hospital as a result of their support and passion for veterinary care for animals. They are also committed to making sure that owners are educated and informed in caring for their pets. They present all treatment options to owners ranging from conservative in non urgent cases to aggressive care with a concise consultation on risk associated with each. This allows owner to make informed decisions. Physicians are supportive of pet owners and will weigh in on the decisions providing substantive and qualitative reasoning for their recommendations. \nAnother note to concerned pet owners in these difficult financial times is that when these vets present care options they do take into consideration conservative measures for non urgent situations and are very conscious of guarding against unnecessary test or diagnostics if they are not needed. This said if they highly recommend testing or diagnostics it is  generally to confirm that aggressive or costly treatments are actually needed and these test may in fact save money in the long run. They will also recommend test if the symptoms of the problem are too broad to narrow down what is truly wrong with an animal. \n\nGreat Medical team at this hospital , I could not ask for more.",2,concat

I had enough time to site and take my time writing this review, and I'm still waiting for this Jerk. From check-in to check-out, Sanctuary Spa provides the ultimate spa experience. When it comes to my spa days, I like to choose wisely because I save my funds very carefully to treat myself to a spa experience. Because I save my pennies so carefully, I want an A+ experience at the spa I choose. Sanctuary gets an A+. \n\nI am going to be very detailed in my review, because when I'm looking for a spa I want to know every little thing about the spa. You will notice that the Sanctuary does an excellent job with the little extras that make a spa experience that much better. \n\nSetting:\n\nThe Sanctuary Spa is nestled on the base of Camelback Mountain. You enter through a plush neighborhood of beautiful houses and walk past state of the art tennis courts before entering the spa. I would call this spa intimate and state of the art. Yes, I've been to bigger spas, but bigger isn't always better. I opened the doors of the spa and entered a small check-in table where the staff greeted me with smiles and charm. They had me give them my CC upon arrival so that I wouldn't have to stop by and pay on my way out if I was in spa-mode. After check-in, they led me through double doors where two more spa attendants waited to give me a tour of the locker room and key to my own locker room. \n\nLadies Locker Room \n\nThe ladies locker room has everything I look for in a spa. It has a vanity area with lotions, hair spray, shaving gels, and several other products to use while getting ready. The bathrooms are spacious and offer mouth wash and disposable tooth brushes and toothpaste for use throughout the day. The private walk-in showers are also spacious and provide shampoo, conditioner, body wash and razors. The individual lockers offer a robe, flip flops and a towel. The jacuzzi is pretty small but on the quiet day I visited, it was just the right size. The waiting room for services is intimate but again, just the right size. They have hot tea, ice cold water, almonds and dried cranberries for guests to enjoy throughout the day. The ladies locker room provides the perfect setting for a relaxing day. \n\nThe Gym \n\nWhen I do spa days, I like to take full advantage of every amenity they offer. After all, I am paying a pretty penny so I want to get my money's worth! I tend to visit the gym first because then I feel even better going into my spa day. This gym is definitely a nice one. They offer complimentary water and Gatorade at the gym. The treadmills overlook a lap pool through large floor to ceiling windows so it's easy to day dream while you workout. The treadmills have TVS and complimentary disposable head phones just in case you forgot yours. They also have ellipticals, weights, bikes and offer a variety of fitness classes throughout the day. \n\nThe Pools \n\nI would say the spa lap pool is the only downfall (in my opinion) at the Sanctuary. During my spa days, I like to enjoy a tranquil pool that's not \""in the scene.\"" I like to saunter out there before and after treatments, lay out and relax. The Sanctuary spa does offer access to their two pools, but one is a lap pool without much \""spa\"" ambiance to it. It's more just like a workout pool with some lounge chairs. The other pool is the stunning negative edge infinity pool in the main hotel area. The pool itself can't be beat and sits against a backdrop of the desert and palm trees. It was beautiful, but it was also in the middle of the action, so it made my spa day a little more rambunctious than I was hoping for. However, the pool itself was beautiful and I've definitely seen wilder pools. Just be prepared to be in the scene if you go. \n\nThe Services \n\nNow let's talk services. I will say that my two technicians might be my favorite of all my spa experiences in the Valley: Sherry especially. Sherry gave me my Sanctuary Jewel facial which is a 50 minute facial that's customized to your skin. From the moment I met Sherry, she was so incredibly nice and made me feel at ease. She's Southern and her Southern friendliness definitely was in full force! Now, getting a facial can be nerve-racking because you are letting someone examine every flaw on your face. It's important that your technician makes you feel comfortable during the facial. Not only did Sherry make me feel comfortable, but she found traits to compliment me on throughout the facial and did it in a truly genuine manner. Not only was she nice, she gave me an amazing facial! I left with my skin glowing and my confidence still intact! For that I will continue to visit Sherry for facials. \n\nI had my massage done by Tara who did such a good job, I nearly fell asleep! Now be prepared for them to try to upsell you on products before the massage. That was the only downfall, but it's not the massage therapists fault for doing what they are told to do! I didn't add any extras, but the regular Swedish massage was all I needed!",2,concat

But then I go use the restroom and the door gets jammed! I yelled for my mother in law to go help me open it because I was literally stuck inside the bathroom. It took about 5 mins to finally be able to open it . She had to push the door open with her whole body..Another star down..\n\nWe go down to the pool to tan and relax for a bit. They do have a small pool and even smaller jacuzzi.  A lazy river. And a wave pool. We walked around and it was beyond crowded you had to search for any empty chairs. The water was so nasty and hazy . I didn't dare to even go into the pool!\n\nBathroom lighting is horrible and the toilet flushing is so loud.. So night time rolls around and it's time for us to shower and get ready so I let my mother in law shower first. When she's done showering she tells me I might have to wait to shower because the tub is full of water.. The drainage was so bad it took forever for the water to go down. So we ran late to dinner because of this . Minus another star.\n\nThe pillows are not comfortable at all! They are so hard I even had to sleep with no pillows since it was unbearable.  On the other side of my bed there was also a big wet stain. Of course I didn't realize it until I stepped on it with my bare feet. I will never know what that was..\n\nAt this point I wish yelp had an option to put zero stars.. I won't ever be staying here again. If everything wasn't so crammed in together I would've been able to complain but by then I just wanted to hurry up and self check out and never stay in this nightmare or a hotel again. If your running on a budget there are plenty of inexpensive hotels on the strip. YOU'VE BEEN WARNED DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY STAYING HERE. One of my new favorite places.  The food is so delicious and reasonably priced and the staff is really friendly.  The music / television can be a bit loud but it is a bar so I can't really complain about it.  I like the Mill Ave location better for people watching on the patio.  Both places are dog friendly!\n\nEverything I've tried is fresh and delicious.  I love their ceviche tostadas, salsa, chips and guac to start, but we've also had the corn dip and it's pretty good.  The tacos are all yummy, and the house salad is really good.  I haven't tried anything I didn't like.  The servers are friendlier than I would expect and that's been consistent so they hire well.\n\nNot sure I would've tried this place based purely on appearances and the bar atmosphere because it's not really our style, but the food keeps bringing us back.  I love it for lunch or an early dinner.",2,concat

First off, we both asked for Caesar salads (which we paid extra for) and we didn't even get them. Besides that, the sauce was less than mediocre - a glorified ketchup with noodles. The chicken was dry and we couldn't eat half of the meals. Overall, very poor experience with spaghetti warehouse. You're better off getting fast food noodles from noodles and company. Seriously disappointed especially since it is called the SPAGHETTI warehouse. Very hard to mess up spaghetti.

I love these quaint little markets because they give you that cozy feeling. Probably because these places are mom and pop owned. Plus supporting your local business is always a good thing.\n\nAs I went in, I am greeted in Japanese by what I assume was one of the owners in the form of a nice old lady. The first thing I looked for was any Kit Kat flavors I havnt tried yet. All they had were the dark chocolate ones. I asked the lady when they get new flavors and all she could tell me was that they are mostly seasonal. \n\nAs I walked around, I noticed a lot of common Japanese staples you would find at other places. For this place I noticed they had all sorts of different kinds of sushi in the refrigerated section. This was something I havnt seen at other Japanese markets or maybe I just wasn't looking hard enough.\n\nSo in my ever growing discovery of Japanese markets, this place is very similar to all the others that I have encountered and will stop by any time I am in the area.\n\n\nYelp 2014 365 Review Challenge #11",2,concat

Erik set up a day to come to house.  The day he was suppose to arrive, he text me just prior and stated he was in Scottsdale at a meeting and would have to reschedule.  I said that was fine. We were initially not able to make our schedules work, and we agreed that he would contact me the following week and re-schedule.  I didn't hear from him that next week, then I was out of town for a few days.  Upon returning, I asked him if he still was going to come out and give an estimate.   \n\nHe chose the time to show up, I agreed to it, ( Friday at 1pm prior to Memorial day weekend) and took time out of my day to arrange to be at the house and go over the prospective job.  He showed up, snapped a picture or two of the worksite, taking no measurements, and 2 minutes later said he'd have to come back in on Tuesday at the same time with his foreman to be able to give an estimate.  At this point I'm wondering why I'd bothered to waste my time.\n\nTuesday arrives, exactly 10 minutes before he and the foreman were scheduled to show up, I get a text asking if he can push the estimate another day.  At this point I was tired of delays, wasting time, and tired of being blown off, so I responded \""Honestly, I want someone who will show up and take the job seriously. You were suppose to meet me before and blew me off and now again today.  And you came out and wasted my time last week.  I could have already had this done weeks ago.  I am all set with contractors who are not professional.  I will be writing a review in regards to your lack of professionalism and promptness.\""\n\nHe responded \""lol... What a joke!! Good luck to you. Please don't waste my time with these text messages.\""\n\nSo, no, sorry to say I can't recommend Erik.

Short version: If you want a massage, whether on your own or a couples massage, forget the sky-high prices on the strip and head over to Massage Pro. It's not a sleazy, cheapo place. It's cozy and professional.\n\nLong version: My husband and I decided to make an impromptu trip to Las Vegas. We booked our hotel two days in advance and winged it while we were there. We knew, though, that we wanted to get a couples massage.\n\nOf course, we headed to Yelp, and read lots of good reviews for the hotel spas, but oh my gosh--$400 for a 50 minute massage? Ouch. No thanks. So, I Googled \""couples massage\"" and came up with three non-day spa/hotel places in Vegas. I called all three, checked reviews on all three, and then checked appointment availability and came up with Massage Pro. Booked an appointment sight unseen, and crossed my fingers.\n\nThe place is right off the strip--just head west on Sahara for a couple miles. It'd be too much to walk, I think, but it's close enough that taking a taxi shouldn't be too expensive. We had our car with us and it was a very quick drive.\n\nWhen my husband and I walked into the office, we were a little worried--the reception is super small and feels a little like a dentist's office. We filled out our paperwork, and were taken back to a much more spacious waiting room with dimmed lights, relaxing music, and a little fountain. From there, we were met by our massage therapists. We did have to wait a little longer than we expected, but it was only seven minutes beyond our appointment time, and they more than made up for it during the session. I think they spent an extra ten or fifteen minutes on us to make it up to us. :)\n\nWe ordered the 90-minute combination massage, which was a blend of Swedish and deep-tissue techniques. We paid just $90 each! Even with a $20 tip on top of each massage, we were still under the next least expensive massage we could find--and the experience was phenomenal!\n\nWe had a male therapist and a female therapist (we had confirmed this was all right when we called and made our appointments) who guided us to a designated Couples Room specially set aside for couples massages. The room was decorated, dimmed, and had soothing music playing. The beds were heated and we were asked if they were to our liking temperature-wise. They were perfect.\n\nDid I mention the therapists are nationally and locally licensed? Yeah. Cool.\n\nSo began ninety minutes of rubby, relaxing bliss. The therapists were receptive to our suggestions--a little softer on that spot, please; a little harder right there. The therapists were nothing but the utmost of professionals, watching our muscles for the relaxation of knots and responses to too much pressure. They adjusted their techniques to our preferences and my husband and I had a wonderfully relaxing afternoon. We had very enjoyable massages.\n\nWe didn't pack robes with us, and, not being a day spa, they don't provide them, so they were kind enough to let us use their shower usually reserved for customers getting body scrubs so we could rinse off some of the massage lotion. We got big, fluffy towels to dry off with and they even gave us an extra one, just in case.\n\nIn short:\nUNBEATABLE prices\nProfessional, personable, skilled, licensed, receptive therapists\nCouples massage room!\nNot a day spa--ambiance is definitely service-oriented, but still decorated and cozy\nAwesome massage\nNot sketchy (they have zero tolerance for inappropriate behavior)\n\nWhat are you waiting for?!

BLECH!\n\nCorporate quality gone amok. Julian Serrano is located just inside the casino entrance to Aria resort at The City Center on the Vegas Strip. It is an upscale fine dining restaurant that features Spanish tapas (or sharing plates). Simone and I arrived in our finest t-shirts, shorts and sneakers. Although not exactly dressed for a formal dinner, I let the hostess know I had made a reservation and we were quickly escorted past the rich and almost famous to the corner table at the far end of the dining room. Reservations are an absolute necessity if you plan to get a table at this restaurant (especially when dressed like a tourist from Maine).After being seated, our very formal waiter quickly offered us a very expensive wine menu and so we decided to get a diet soda and water ( from the tap). We looked over the menu and decided that we wanted to try the Paella as our entree that we would share. The Paella takes at least 35 minutes to prepare so we placed our order before deciding on our smaller tapas plates. First up we decided on a plate of marinated olives. When they arrived we realized that they were not pitted, so we had fun seeing who could make the biggest mess while trying to get the pits out. The waiter seemed amused by this. The olives were very good and were marinated in roasted garlic and baby onions. For our second tapas we decided to get more adventurous and ordered the Albondigas, which were mini Meatballs cooked in a Tomato and Sherry Sauce. They were some of the most tender meatballs I have ever eaten and they just melted in the mouth. The sauce was mild and light with a nice hint of sherry and also included some roasted baby potatoes.  Our last tapas choice was the new age Egg Potato & Morcilla dish. The dish was a combination of sauteed Wild Mushrooms and Blood Sausage with a soft poached egg, atop a pool of Potato Foam topped with Manchego Cheese Air. This dish was truly memorable and one of the most unique things I have ever eaten. The richness of the sausage and egg combined magicaly with the smokey earthiness of the mushrooms and the potato foam and Manchego air melted away to create a creamy sauce for it all. This dish was a real culinary adventure.  Our Valencia Paella was ready and came to the table piping hot and served in the cast iron pan it was cooked in. It was a delicious combination of baked Saffron laced Spanish rice with house made Chorizo sausage, sauteed Rabbit and tender grilled Chicken topped of with roasted Haricot Verde Green Beans.  We managed to finish off the rather large Paella meal, and then wrapped things up with a dessert tapas of Almond Sponge Cake with Homemade Almond Ice Cream. It was super dense, super moist and super good.  Our entire meal and experience at Julian Serrano was one that I will not soon forget. It was creative, unique and prepared perfectly. I would recommend this to anyone that doesn't mind shelling out a few extra bucks to have the perfect culinary adventure. And next time I'll even wear pants...maybe.",2,concat

And there's a sound system on the wall where you can choose mood music by genre or just hook up your own ipod and play your own show tunes... nice touch.\n\nEven though we reserved a King bed, we got two Queen beds... but, we made use of both. One can really put on a show in the bathroom, as it's only divided by the bedroom with a wall of glass. But, there is a large curtain that can be pulled closed- but what's the fun in that?

Not nearly enough sauce or cheese, and scant toppings. Wow....super disappointed. The wings were passable, but barely. Also, no carrots or celery. Amateur league, guys. Seriously... First thing's first, ask to sit in Adam's section. He is the best at what he does. Attentive, polite and entertaining. Ask me again if I want Baileys in my coffee and I'd probably say, \""Yes, pour it up, pour it up.\"" Almost had to go all RiRi on him.\n\nSecond thing, ladies/gentlemen/pool go-ers, you will not be served by the restaurant if you are not actually wearing clothes. Aka, bikini tops/bottoms, tankinis and midriffs are not allowed. The host will probably tell you to go back to your room and change. \n\nOkay, now to my review of my overall experience.\n\nWe got to the restaurant on a Sunday at around 12pm to have brunch. Like a boss, we were seated within five minutes of arriving. ***DISCLAIMER: THERE ARE NO BOTTOMLESS MIMOSAS HERE.*** Kind of the first thing I look for when I go to any Sunday brunch, nowadays. Don't worry, I don't have a problem.\n\nChocolate croissant: Flakiest chocolate croissant I've ever had with slivers of almond and a drizzle of chocolate on top. Absolutely perfect.\n\nRaspberry beignets: Not my favorite of the selection because the raspberry jam within the beignet was too sweet and the entire thing was just coated with sugar, so too sweet for my taste, but hey, who's to say this won't be the perfect fancy donut hole for some other brunch go-er.\n\nSteak Frites: Those frites tho. They are probably the best I've ever had. Next to anything with truffle oil on them. So, take note, Bouchon, I like truffle fries as much as the next person. Can I get an 'amen?' Steak was cooked perfectly and covered with onions. Now, if you're weird like me and don't like the taste of the onions, then refrain, refrain, refrain from ordering this. Or you can ask them to omit the onions, but I'd rather get the food the way that it's supposed to come. \n\nChicken and Waffles: Bacon, bacon and bacon. Whaaat? Yeah. If you're looking for greasy fried chicken, you're not gonna get it with their version. It is a roasted half chicken with a side of chive waffles. And you guessed it, there's also bits of bacon in the chive waffles. Also comes with a side of gravy that comes with plenty of, you guessed it again, bacon. I was halfway expecting the maple syrup to be bacon infused. But I didn't even use the maple syrup, so I guess I'll never know. The chicken was moist, the skin slightly charred and the gravy added the perfect saltiness that the chicken needed. The waffles were a perfect balance of sweet and salty. \n\nI, also, ordered a coffee, which they kept filling and piping hot. \n\nThe overall experience was great. I have no complaints. The service is the best. Make sure you ask to sit in Adam's section.",2,concat

The only thing that I can think of is that the passage of time dulled my senses and made me forget about my prior experiences, but I have written myself a note reminding myself to avoid this place in the future. \n\nThis restaurant has survived on the hype of being one of the only \""nice\"" places downtown, but luckily that has changed.  I went there for dinner one night and because I did not feel like ordering a $20 salad, I decided to order a $15 sandwich.  THe only thing that I can think of is that upon hearing my order the \""chef\"" immediately ran down to the nearest vending machine and got a roast beef sandwich out of that vending machine, took the sandwich out of the plastic wrap and plopped it down on the plate and actually had the gonads to serve it as if they made it!  It was by far the worst meal I have had in some time and is a constant reminder why I will not eat there again, unless my Alzheimers kicks in.  \n\nIf you have to go there my recommendation is that you eat before hand and simply order a martini.\n\nikk8ide 2ccccccc. Hands down my favorite hotel in Vegas. The MO franchise continues to impress me with how they effortlessly blend their Far East zen-and-beauty identity into any environment. MOLV is no exception, as it defies odds by being a peaceful oasis in the middle of a sinister desert (literally) that is Vegas. \n\nUpon arrival, we were thoughtfully greeted by the concierge (who offered us tea during check in). When we entered our room, the windows automatically pulled open and a brilliant glance of the Vegas strip was readily in front of us. Rooms are spacious and the amenities plentiful. Bathrooms include both a standing shower and a huge bathtub (not to mention two sinks...a true luxury). The bed is so comfy, especially after a long flight out west/non-stop gambling.\n\nWhile MOLV does not have a casino itself, there are too many near by for matter. Aria is walking distance via the sky bridge, and Monte Carlo (among others) are all within a 5 min walk.\n\nSome other things to love:\n\nWake up in the AM and take a dip in the pool. Not your typical pool park, but big enough to relax and roam around. There are a mix of jacuzzis and swimming pools to enjoy from.\n\nBreakfast at MOzen. Simple but flavorful Chinese (and Western) breakfast. Prices are up there, but definitely worth your hangover cure/detox. Get up early, eat the congee, and conquer the day at casinos around the strip!\n\nJanice - this review is dedicated to you :)",2,concat

That part broke.\"" \n\nHim: \""A Collegiate or a Speedster?\"" \n\nMe (amazed): \""Speedster.\"" \n\nAt which point he turned around to a wall of tiny drawers that seemed to stretch from floor to ceiling and appeared to have no intelligible labeling, pull open a single drawer, and produce the part I needed. It cost something like 30 cents... \n\nPlaces like this pretty much do not exist anymore, the shop is like a museum of bicycle parts (and the upper stories of the building are reportedly just as full).

I then hike into the hotel where I am greeted with a line resembling space mountain on a Saturday in July to just check in! There are 5 or 6 people working the main desk and I see a self serve kiosk so I attempt to use this. I walk over to see 3 of the 5 terminals are \""out of order\"" and the two that do work require a credit card only, no debit is accepted. So I sit here in line writing this. Defiantly the worst experience I have ever had in Las Vegas. Haven't even seen the room yet! Let's hope for my sanity it is nice. Will edit this with results. Another round of MANGIA! with Chef Marc in the Steppin' Out series (Round 5), another great Italian food-inspired meal at Chef Marc's now expanded rustic Parma by Chef Marc ristorante.\n\nFIRST COURSE: As a first course, those partaking of Chef Marc's fine Chef's Table presentation were treated to a Deconstructed Caprese Salad with Buffalo Mozzarella and Tomato Pulp that had been freed of all acid, plated atop first-rate Balsamic Vinegar.  Green flecks that tasted like faint Pesto were also on the plate.  This concoction was very tasty, including the best Buffalo Mozzarella I have experienced to date.  Chef Marc imparted that this cheese was derived from water buffalo cow inhabiting the environs of Naples.\n\nSECOND COURSE: For a second course, we were presented with two very large platters of New York Style Hot Antipasto for every 3 diners, so that, try as we might, some of this delectable food was left behind.  We got to sample Eggplant rolled up like a burrito or Chinese Eggroll but not deep-fried; lovely Clams filled with Oregano, Parsley, and Bread Crumbs to become Clam Oreganata; naked Calamari; Mussels filled with Artichoke Hearts; and some Green Peppers and cut mushrooms spread throughout the hot platters like accent marks unifying all elements of this sumptuous and quite filling appetizer.  Would that Western Style Antipasto plates were this tasty and refined!\n\nAlso complementing this dish was excellent cheese-topped and crusty bread and butter.  But, alas, Chef Marc directed his servers to remove the bread soon after the repast began, lest we fill up too much on it.\n\nTHIRD COURSE: For the next course, we were treated to a very hot and nuanced Spinach & Walnut Risotto with flakes of Mascarpone Cheese circling 'round the rim of the bowl.  This rich offering was quite flavorful without any single component overpowering the others.\n\nFOURTH COURSE: As a main course, set down before us was a bowl of rich, delicious, and fork-tender Slow-braised Neapolitan Veal Cheek, along with German-style Red Cabbage made with Brown Sugar and Red Wine Vinegar, and subtly flavored Polenta.  The star of this assemblage was the Veal Cheek, which tasted much like well-prepared Osso Buco.  And, Chef Marc confirmed that this entree did actually come from the cheeks of young calves.  \n\nFIFTH COURSE:  As a fifth and final course, we were treated to a dessert plate with slices of Green Apple, honey in a small pouring bowl, Blueberries, and somewhat springy planks of solid Parmesan Cheese that Chef Marc referred to as \""diving boards.\""  These elements were to be assembled and joined together according to our personal whims.  I found that dabs of honey acted like glue when Blueberries were pressed into them on top of a plank of cheese, and the conglomeration was further sweetened by adding a honey-soaked slice of apple into the mouth when chewing.  This sweet and cheesy dish was my least favorite course, but I appreciated the simplicity and inventiveness of the dish.  Everything else I thought was both creative and a foodie's delight. \n\nThroughout the meal, Chef Marc or one of his assistants provided a running commentary of each course just before it was served, and patiently answered all diners' questions.  This added to the enjoyment of the experience, although in previous MANGIA! rounds Chef Marc did all the narration himself, which I liked better.\n\nMost of our group of about 17 diners experienced the Chef's Table (some with wine pairings), but a few, like Diane, ordered ala carte.  And, she was quite pleased with the two quite large and lean scallops of Veal Parmesan Alfredo and Penne Alfredo with which she was presented.  Half of the order served as a fine lunch the next day.\n\nNelson and Sylvia Q. presented all diners with a vial of sand from different beaches in Hawaii, and did another great job in organizing this event.  Props to them for hosting, and to Chef Marc and his staff for preparing and serving, yet another outstanding MANGIA! dining extravaganza!",2,concat

Brought it back on time and full of gas. 3 days later I'm getting over $1200 worth of charges on my card from Hertz. Then a day later an automated \""urgent\"" phone call saying I never returned the car. Seriously?!? It takes 4 days for them to realize an $85,000.00 luxury car wasn't returned??? Considering it was already returned, I don't know what's worse. The fact that is was and they had no clue or the fact that it took a machine 4 days to call me asking about it. After multiple attempts to reach the people at the actual Hertz desk at the airport without going through the 800 number and talking to someone in Michigan. I finally had to take time out of my day to drive back down to the airport only to wait in line and then speak to a manager. Never in my life have I met a more lazy, incompetent, unapologetic manger (Veronica). When I walked up she was sitting down in her chair at the desk(no other employee was sitting even though they all had chairs at their computers) I explain the situation and she proceeds to make 4 different phone calls trying to locate the \""unreturned\"" car. After she finds it she informs me it was put to the side so parts could be ordered for it. She asks the person on the other line if she needs to charge me for the parts? Yes apparently I stole the cupholder out of the jag which they valued at $80. Yea ya know they're right that jaguar cup holder just looks and fits so good in my Mercedes. (If you didn't pick up on it that was sarcasm)\n\nAfter much argument she told me I chose coverage for the car when I rented it so I'm not responsible for the cupholder. After wasting quite enough time I asked for a printed invoice of my final bill. She then says she doesn't have a printer. Really you don't have a printer? There is literally over 20 computers at the hertz desk. \""I don't have a printer but she does\"" pointing to an employee next to us helping other people. Bottom line is she was to lazy to stand up and move to one of the other 18 open computers and print my receipt. She told another guy to walk over and do it. Bottom line she was incredibly rude, lazy, disrespectful and made no attempt to offer an apology for the huge mistake and waste of time on my part. After asking at the very end \""so no apology what so ever? She offered a measly \""sorry\"" \n\nVeronica please do us all a favor and resign or learn some basic manners, take a little more initiative and learn to offer an apology when you know your company is in the wrong.

When work was done, it was unsupervised, and thus some things needed to be redone multiple times to get them done right, such as moving the PVC pipe covered utilities away from the pool, where the workers had placed them sticking 3 feet up from the ground, right next to the spa. It took two times before they placed behind the fountain where they could not be seen. They also had problems tiling the fountain backsplash, and when they had to tear it up, they put all their garbage in my recycling bin. Fortunately I noticed it, as I am sure I would have been fined by city of Scottsdale  had I not. He very reluctantly came to empty the can, and seemed to think it was quite unreasonable for me to ask for him to do that. The last straw was when they dug the gas line. He did not supervise or use a locator service and when I returned from my trip, I found power outages all aver the house. Turned out that they had hit an electrical conduit, and damaged it so severely that it pulled wires out of the wall on a sub panel. Then instead of owning up to it, they covered it up. Bill of course was right there trying to collect his final bill before this damage was discovered. I refused to pay it at the time because the yard was left a total mess. When he saw the electricians in the yard, he was acting very nervous, and told them that they did not  do anything. It took 3 electricians hours to locate the damage, and when they did, he refused to take any responsibility initially what so ever.

The best part of my experience at this over priced, noisy, average foods quality wing joint is that the service is so slow that I have time to write this review.

It was a suite that connects to two other rooms on the 33rd floor. Our friends ended up getting the two connected rooms and we had a blast! The view was great and it was attached to the Miracle Mile Shops. It was a few minutes walk to Planet Hollywood Casino, Bellagio, Cosmopolitan, and The Paris. Same goes for all the eateries. It was super inexpensive. \n\nThe decor was on the modern/contemporary style. The color scheme throughout the Elara was red, white, and black. It was definitely on the \""younger\"" side, in terms of clientele - between 25-40.\n\nEach of us paid around $150 for 3 nights with one of our friend's discounts. It was a great deal for a large group of people. We party in the suite and on the strip. This hotel gives you the full effect of Vegas without the expensive of being in one of the more expensive, renown hotels. \n\nIf you're looking for a not so inexpensive stay with a group of friends, definitely go for the Elara!

My friend and I tried this place on a whim because she heard they had good fried pickles.  Am I ever glad we stopped in!  The drinks are especially unique and it's a nice change from the typical Freemont Street spot to grab a snack.  Definitely more upscale than the usual with friendly staff, good food and unusual (and very delicious) cocktails. Drink prices are average to the other bars nearby, but the quality is much better.  If you're going to spend $8 for a cocktail on Freemont you'll get a better drink here than at the frozen drink stand down the road.  We had a couple of appetizers, a couple of cocktails and some good conversation with Chris, our waiter.  Definitely recommended!  I will be stopping here for sure next time I'm in Vegas. Called this place based off of yelp reviews, and after my whole incident with this place went through the reviews again, and something is definitely fishy about this business' yelp page. \n\nSo I call the number listed, no answer, so I leave a message saying everything I was looking for. Someone called back saying they were with Arizona Pest Squad and missed a call from my number. I asked if he listed to my message, he said no. So I had to explain myself all over again. At the end he said he would be at my house around 430. I thought to myself, same day service?! How awesome. 430 comes, 530 comes, 630 comes and they call saying that they got caught on a job with bees. Understandable, but a call before you were gonna be late would have been awesome so I didn't sit around waiting for you. Person said he could come out right then or about the same time the next day. I said right then worked, he then asked if the next day would be ok.... sooooo why did you give me a choice if you weren't going to go with the one I picked? Anyways he offered 50% off to do it the next day around 430, and I'll never say no to cheap stuff. \n\nSame thing next day, except this time he called about 530. I didn't even answer because I couldn't believe I fell for it a second time. He left a message saying he didn't want to come out because it was raining, but would if I wanted him to. I didn't call back. I go out in the living room and see something in my door frame, a note saying sorry we missed you, it's raining, will call to make another appt. Never knocked or rang the doorbell. I have two large dogs, who have something against doorbells and anyone who touches the door, so I know for a fact there was no effort to get my attention while at the house. \n\nSo I write the managers an e-mail explaining my whole story. Apparently the guy I had been talking to was a owner. He kept referring the the \""yelp review\"" I wrote, when I had just e-mailed him and never said a word about it on yelp, yet. He offered to service my property for free. I couldn't say no to free stuff, so we set it up a fourth time.... when am I gonna learn, right? \n\nI waited until the time we discussed, and at the exact minute he was late, I left to go workout. I was done with this company. He doesn't call me till an hour later saying he's at my house, and to call back and reschedule... AGAIN. No thanks, you couldn't pay me to waste anymore of my time waiting for a company that couldn't show up to save their lives. Run fellow yelpers, run. \n\nIt is one thing to be late and let someone know, it is another to be late four times, and not call till at least an hour later every time.

This is a nice cut of meat and cook perfectly.  \n\nI went the first night and ordered the S & E special finished it and ordered another one. Then went back the next morning. Tasty. I recommend. Here's the short version: Worst possible dining experience, no exaggeration. Wrong reservation, terrible service, bad food, and promises broken for a business dinner with our best client.\n\nHere's the long version: Came here for a business dinner for our most important client on a recommendation. We made our reservation for their private dining area 2 months in advance to coincide with a trade show. Confirmed our reservation a week or two in advance as well. \n\nI checked in with the hostess with about half of our 20+ party there. They said our table would be ready soon and to let them know when our entire party was there. Our entire party arrived about 5 minutes later and I informed them that all were present and she said our table would be ready in a few minutes. After another 5 minutes I check to see if our table was ready. Said it would be soon, just a few minutes. After another 5 minutes I asked about our table and again the answer was soon. Not a good thing to keep a large group and important clients waiting 15 minutes for a private room that was supposed to be reserved. \n\nFinally we were told our tables were ready but it was just that, normal tables in their regular dining area. We informed them that their must be a mistake since we specifically reserved their private dining room. We were given some attitude and told that we were mistaken but they would look into it. They quickly learned from their group reservation department that their was some sort of lack or mix-up of communication between them and the hostess. The general manager shows up and began to sweat and apologize to us a thousand times. \n\nNothing could be done at the time because they had already given away tables in their private dining area. There was only an approximate estimate of an hour wait to move to that area. We decided to start at the tables we had and move if the private area became available soon. \n\nFortunately they said they would be able to move us to the private area after 20 minutes so we headed over. Unfortunately it was not a private room but just a semi-private area partially enclosed by glass walls. And there were still some other diners in the area but we were assured the tables would remain empty once they finished. \n\nAfter all of this drama I thought to myself \""hopefully the food is AMAZING and redeems this entire mess.\"" However, I was thoroughly disappointed. The blue crab chowder was too salty, the prime rib was mediocre at best (I'd rather have Bellagio buffet prime rib), and the desserts were forgetful. \n\nIn addition, the service was pretty poor. A number of us had finished our drinks and had empty glasses on our table. They remained empty on our table for at least 20-30 minutes. When I had my water refilled I asked them to take away my other empty glass. It was taken away but all of the other empty glasses were ignored. It was bizarre to me that this simple task was overlooked, especially after the general manager said that he would make sure that we were taken care of and serviced well. He also mentioned that he would give us additional drinks and food and not charge us. After we received the final bill that didn't seem to be the case and it looked like we were charged the full amount. \n\nWhat added insult to this all was that the other tables in our semi-private dining area didn't remain empty, they continued to fill them with new diners. We spent about $5000 for the worst possible dining experience on clients who do over $50 million in business with us.",2,concat

The layout is upstairs and downstairs which was a little strange but space is a premium.  The service and menu was awesome.  Most steakhouses you will drop an easy $100 / person, it was refreshing to go one in the city thats not trying to rob you.  They serve 1/2 glasses of wine so we were able to try 6 different wines.   Had the bacon, crab cake, pork belly, Kale salad, and turtle sundae.  Everything was very flavorful.  The only thing that could of been better was the seasoning of some of the dishes.  We will definitely go back. Customer service is of utmost importance if you are running a restaurant. This place has none.\n\nWent on 11/6 with a friend to this restaurant.

Before you order, they explain the different types of steak that they offer by actually bringing the meat on a cart out to the table.  Everything that I ate was delicious and I am not a huge red meat eater.  The quality of the meat was wonderful.  We each ordered the plates that included a cut of several of the steaks.  It was cool to be able to taste each steak without having to actually order several different steaks.  It is very expensive, but in my opinion, it was totally worth it. I really don't want to have to do this because I've had such amazing experiences at Lebowskis before. But if this had been my first visit I would never be going back.\nWent for a Saturday night dinner and drinks treat and expected a lot better. I'd have the meat platter before and was craving it so was disappointed when it was no longer on the menu. When I asked the waitress about it I was reassured they still did it, it just wasn't printed on the menu. I happily handed over my money and sat back in anticipation. But what turned up was worse that dreadful. 4 slices of what i can only assume was Salisbury's bread along with a bundle of salmon, a bowl of haggis, bowl of black pudding and the worst over cooked steak I've ever attempted to eat. And that was all. What happened to the salad, the oatcakes, the chicken, the cooking skills??!! Eventually after prompting, the waitress brought me some cutlery and a few slices of lemon from the bar. \nI don't know what was going on in Lebowskis on Saturday but it was all dreadful.

Yes, you heard me, they have concocted a chocolate bar with bits of applewood smoked bacon in it.  Granted, it tasted a little weird, but that kind of inventiveness deserves 5 stars.\n\nBoth times that I visited here, the staff were really good about giving samples of their merchandise.  They always have a featured chocolate bar with samples - the first time, it was the Barcelona bar (almonds and grey sea salt) and the second, it was Mo's Bacon Bar, the aforementioned treat.  According to them, the bacon bar was brand new and they had just gotten it in.  We also got to try the Naga bar, which, along with the Barcelona, was the favorite.\n\nWe ended up getting two boxes of milk chocolate truffles (9 pieces for $25) as gifts, the Barcelona and Naga bars, and a quarter pound of their caramel toffee.

I also regret not buying the bacon bar, which probably would have made for some fun sampling with the family back home. \n\nA great chocolate store with some slightly kooky, exotic confections that work surprisingly well.  I only wish that they had an outlet in San Francisco so that I can try out more chocolates and have a steady supply of their delicious toffee.

Even without the special their normal prices are awesome, with pitchers of quality beer for only $9!

It's certainly rare to find a restaurant with 5 stars after this number of reviews.  I had to try it to believe it.\n\nFood (9.5/10) = Simply incredible.  The first time I visited Gaucho, I went with the most frequently mentioned Yelp item - the carne (steak) sandwich.  This sandwich is HUGE!  Generous portions of a cut of your choice.  I go for the ribeye, which is a great choice for flavor.  Other components of the sandwich include roasted red bell peppers, onions, chimmi churri sauce.  The bread just absorbs all the juices from the meat and roasted peppers, not letting any flavor go to waste.\n\nIf a sandwich is not your thing, there's certainly a variety of other proteins for your choosing, both from the land and sea.  I was surprised and impressed with how absolutely delicious Gaucho's camarones (shrimp) were.  I'm always weary of ordering seafood if I'm not near the coast line, with the concern for freshness.  But goddamn, these shrimps were hella succulent.  Sooo succulent.\n\nOther worthy proteins include the chorizo, chicken, and flank steak.\n\nIf you're in the mood for some vegetables, Gaucho's grilled corn, and their mix of asparagus, portabello, onions, peppers, zuchinni, are also great choices.\n\nIf you still need more flavor, there are 4 sauces to help enhance the experience:   1) chimmi churri (fresh herbs, garlic, extra virgin olive oil, vinegars), 2) pimenton (charred pepper, garlic, fresh herbs, extra virgin olive oil), 3) ajo (roasted garlic, fresh herbs & extra virgin olive oil), 4) cebolla (carmelized onion, rosemary, thyme, vinegars & extra virgin olive oil)\n\nService (10/10) = Family owned business are always great.  The two brothers running this joint never fail in making you feel welcome, and are full of energy and enthusiasm for the food they prepare.\n\nAmbiance (8.0/10) = The place is small and cozy, and unfortunately there are only a handful of stools for people to sit on, as they enjoy the greatness of Gaucho.\n\nOverall Opinion = Incredible food.  Awesome service.  What more could you possibly want?  Well, my only annoyance with this place are their business hours and the very limited number of seats for people to chill out and enjoy their food.  I heard they are about to expand, so this will solve the latter issue.  Their business hours were a major influence on why it took me more than half a year after moving to Pittsburgh to finally visit this place.  It would be great if they opened until at least 8 or 9 pm.  It would also be great if they opened on Sundays.  Nevertheless, their business is thriving, and certainly not short on customers.  Like I said in the beginning of this review, Gaucho had an average of 5 stars after 100 reviews.  I now understand why.  It is TRUTH!  Now make your pilgrimage to this fine establishment in the Strip District. i would never ever recommend them to anyone ever! first lets start with i only had my braces for 7 months. i have seen them every single month and has a payment every single month. back in may when i had my rubberbands changed they told me i was a month behind come to find out they applied my payment to a general payment and i never had any general work done! they said its from xrays they took when i asked them before they started anything will need to repay for xrays because if so i can have my general dentist send over my xrays since i just paid to have some done a day prior to my braces consultation i was told no i dont have to pay its included in the free exam. i call today and they tell me im 285.00 bucks behind and they will not apply one of the payments i made to the ortho account because i was charged for xrays then told me that i have only paid 3 payments out of the 7 months i have had it and thats not true because had i not made those payments they would of damn sure made me pay them before i got any work done. corporate is rude and the office staff sucks. they can do what they want with that contract because i will be taking my business somewhere else and i will be also filing a complaint with the bbb right along with everyone else that has! straight fraud! and whats even worse! my brackets keep falling off! but they want to harass you for payments but cant fix your teeth right! a bunch of losers! dont go to western dental this is a warning they are a bunch of rude scame artists!",2,concat

This show is more lighthearted than other cirque shows I have seen and is probably great to bring kids to. 'O' is a more sophisticated show, but it doesn't make Zarkana worse, its just different with a different appeal. The acrobats are the true stars of the show and five stars are for their incredible talents and the risk they take every single day to put on this show for all of us. We also got tickets at the half price booth  but they were only slightly discounted (not half price) and we sat in the center (front to middle) orchestra and had a great view of everything happening on stage. I've been to other Doctors Express locations and loved them, so when my 4 year old got sick, I didn't hesitate to take her the one on Camelback.   Well, the waiting room is clean and the staff were nice. However, the doctor at the Camelback location was absolutely horrible. He spent less than one minute examining my daughter and then looked at me and asked, \""Well what do you think I should do?\""  In the end he misdiagnosed my daughter and seven days later I had to go to another urgent care where they told me she had pneumonia.   If you have to go to this urgent care, refuse to see the old, male doctor. He's far from decent.",2,concat

Honestly I couldn't pick up on an overlying story other then a man chasing a woman (he loves I presume). I get the feeling of through a dreamscape- but I could be wrong. Honestly I get lost in subtlety so don't let that bias you. The show is stunning! The acrobatics are fantastic. The high dives leave you squealing. There's comical scenes, creepy scenes, intense scenes (pyrotechnics!) and amazing displays of physical feats at every turn. I've seen it twice now, once from the very back nose bleed section and once front row. There is not a bad seat in the house, and there is always something new you didn't see before. And don't let the idea of the stage being water deter you from the physical strengths and intensity of the show- different parts of the stage moves so that not always are the aero acrobatics safely going to land in a pool of they fall.... If I could give a negative star rating I would. I will say that I have had 4 previous experinces with 2 stylists who were great. they were patient with my 3 year old and gave him a great cut. Then today happened. Like the other reviewer stated long wait time, stylist looked at us and walked into the back room. when she finally appeared I wished she had stayed in the back. My 3 yr old sat for the trimmers but started to cry when she got the scissors. I kept looking at his hair and something was off, I finally realized she went over an inch too high with the clippers and it was uneven in the back beyond repair. How do I know this, my parents owned and operated a salon for 20 yrs, I spent many days after school sweeping hair! When I called out her mistaked she claimed it could be blended. Finally another stylist came over and had to give her instructions on how to fix it. That tells me she is an inexperienced stylist. She continued to make it worse, now my son is in full meltdown and if she moved any slower she wouls be stopped. I finally told her to buzz his head. Then she refused to clean up his neck and trim his ears all the while saying it was his fault she did an uneven cut with the clippers. Really we blame 3 yr olds? She continued to argue then stomped into the back room. I packed up my kids, some 20 something mgr appeared and while she was asking what happened stylist 2 chimed in. At this point I an livid and yelling. Long story short they jacked my sons hair to the point it had to be shaved, NEVER once said SORRY and continue to blame it on him. I left without paying. The punch line, I called my husband and told him the story and he asked me what she looked like. I described her and it turns out that 3 weeks earlier she cut my husbands hair and jacked it so bad that when he walked through the door I burst out laughing. It was probably his fault for moving.LOL I will never be back an will tell everyone with an ear to avoid this place like the plague.",2,concat

The whole show was really fantastic and it was great that there was a storyline. Although it could be a little difficult to follow at times, the scenes are really amazing. One of the best shows I've seen in Vegas and it definitely competes right up there with Cirque's O. I have seen Love and Le Reve and I don't think they were as technically amazing as KA. The theater itself is impressive enough and the show blew me away.\n\nA few things to note: \n-The show is about an hour 45 minutes (totally passes by so fast!). Don't go on a bathroom break! You'll miss stuff. \n-Bring a jacket, because it does get cold in theater.\n-Look EVERYWHERE. The sets are designed for all the seats in the theater.\n-Look for deals on great seats! When I went I saw a promo code on travel zoo for 30% off orchestra seating. It was a great deal and we had really great seats. I've never paid full price for Cirque tickets because there are usually deals on every one of their shows. \n- Check for seating online and by telephone. I also called in and spoke with someone to book my tickets to the show. They gave me better seating then the ones I found online. So it's good to do both to snag better seats!\n\nKA is soooo good that I would totally watch it again. =) We booked our trip to CES really late and had to stay at the Stratosphere. I heard that it was a decent hotel but was still a little weary.  First of all, its located at the end of the strip right before downtown. It starts to get sketchy near Circus Circus.  One of the workers advised us to always take a cab at night because it can get a little dangerous.\n\nSecond, I had booked a non smoking room with two queen beds. They didn't have it when I arrived but had a smoking room. I didn't wanna sleep in a smoky room so they gave me a non smoking one bed and said I could switch tomorrow.  The room smelled of smoke.   Did the switch the next day which was annoying but it was fine.  Room was better and didn't smell.\n\nThird, they charge you 11.99 per day for internet and $1 for LOCAL calls. WTF?\n\nFourth - everytime I called them to the front desk, I either got hung up on or disconnected.  Everything I asked for never came.\n\nFifth, I asked for late checkout on Sunday and figured it wouldn't be a problem since the conference was over.  Flight wasn't until 4 so I didn't want to have to just hang out in the casino or airport. $30 for a late checkout. \n\nSo the service is horrible, they charge you for anything and everything. Its far from everything and gets dangerous at night.  Also, not entirely related by the waitress at their bar on 107 was rude. Booo to Stratosphere. Avoid staying here if possible.",2,concat

I was in the store to buy a few new suits and am very unhappy with how one of them fits. I feel like a 10 year old wearing my dads suit. It is gigantic. After a few alterations the suit still felt big. When I had it altered initially I mentioned that the suit was huge and the store associate darla said it looked good and they couldn't take it in anymore. A few weeks later I wore the suit once and it was horrible. Jacket was too long and the pants made me feel like I was wearing a tent. I took it back. They said they could alter it. The staff was not apologetic for not doing it right the first time and overall the team was very unfriendly. Like I was an inconvenience in their day. They said they could alter it would cost me another $15 and would take almost 10+ days. I will get this suit, but will not be buying anything here again.

While the building is amazing, the food is not good at all and the service is worse. We waited over 30 min after we paid our check to get a to-go bean burrito. The \""acting manager\"" was also the cook and was not concerned about the issue. The corn was dried out and tasted like it was from a can. The cherry chipotle steak tacos got its flavor from the slathered on chipotle mayo. Phoenix KNOWS great Mexican food and this is not it. Save cash and go to Ranch Market.

Biblos is the kind of place that you walk past all the time, never having any inclination of entering, but then somehow end up there. There is nothing particularly appealing about Biblos from the outside. We are always on the hunt for wifi, and Biblos unabashedly welcomed us inside, albeit desperately and in the absence of any hint of self-respect (see: Budweiser tattoo above door).\n\nUpon entering, we sat in what was undoubtedly the sole appealing aesthetic of the place: a cozy library-esque nook with big armchairs and shelves lined with books. Maybe they could have pulled off that kind of atmosphere if it weren't for the abrasive lighting and large flat screen television mounted directly above the Charles Dickens novels. This place might have -- maybe -- appeared hip and progressive circa 2002. As you sit there, numbly staring at the large posters obstructing what would otherwise be an interesting window view of Nicolson Street, and another one of the least memorable (and rightly so) hits of the early millennium rolls on without hesitation, you may find yourself wondering what life choices you have made to predestine your visit to this establishment. \n\n\""Hey guys, look! All food 25% off! What could go wrong!\"" you might say. Nothing weird about that, right? We got the nachos and the restaurant's eponymous salad. The nachos were sloppily thrown together, with globs of guacamole, sour cream, and what they referred to as salsa clumped into the center of the chips, although I can't say they tasted terrible - but then again, what can go wrong with cheese and chips. At least we cleared the whole plate. The same sadly cannot be said for the Biblos salad. \n\nAs for the drinks, they were the most acceptable aspect of Biblos we saw on that fateful evening. We got a Pi\u00f1a Colada and a Dark 'n' Stormy, both of which were decent (don't get excited). One upside: if you have a student ID, there are quite a few discounts on drinks, and both were of reasonable size considering the mere \u00a33.70 we had to shell out.\n\nUltimately, I guess you get what you pay for at Biblos, and I mean that in a bad way. There are deals to be had here, but best to spend your money elsewhere.",2,concat

The staff was unprofessional, and did not acknowledge our initial concern of our safety when the rope continued to be pulled away due to  the crowd trying to walk through.

The shrimp were very tiny and the sauce was so spicy, you couldn't taste anything else.

I had a very bad experience here while visiting Las Vegas with my family for the holiday. \n\nWhen we arrive, we waited for about 15 minutes to be seated which is fine. First, they tried to sit us at a table. When we're standing near the table getting ready to sit, another waiter came over and told the hostess not to sit us there so we had to go back and wait again. 5 minutes later we finally sit down. \n\nWhen getting our drinks, the waiter asks if we are \""local\"". We found this odd because usually people as if we're visiting or not. What does it mattter if we're local? We tell the waiter we're visiting for the holiday. After getting our drinks, we're told to move again because someone just put in a reservation for 12 and they needed room.\n\nWhile ordering, we specifically tell the waiter to bring out the appetizers first before the entrees. The table we had was small so we didn't want the clutter. My mother's Rad Nah dish comes out first anyways. We tell them to take it back and bring out the dish when we all get our entrees. The appetizers were papaya salad and thai beef salad. They taste ok but I've had alot better. When the entrees come out, we find that all the meat is not cook thoroughly in most our dishes. In my brother's pad thai, the imitation crab meat was not even cooked. It looked they threw the meat in straight from the package. After asking for the dish to be recooked, the pad thai comes back super sweet like someone dumped some high fructose corn syrup on the dish. The dish in inedible. My mother's dish also has meat that is under cooked. She just eat the noodles trying not to cause a fuss. My dish was ok. Crispy pork that was a little salty but at least edible.\n\nMaybe if we told the waiter we were local, we would have been treated better. Since we're visiting and might not come back for a while, the restaurant acted like they didn't care about us.\n\nIn the end, we just went to In-N-Out Burger. They never disappoint like this mess of a Thai restaurant did.",2,concat

Then this family came and cut in, this lady ( the mom) cut in with a straight face and didn't even care cause she knows she's doing it on purpose. My husband told her husband we were in line but I said to him it's ok cause they were only party of 3 and we have 6 in our group anyway.

I was wrong...\n\nPoke Express is a small deli-type store which serves... you guessed it... poke! For those of you who do not know, poke is small cuts of fish (mostly tuna) that are seasoned and served cold. The poke selection is not as big as those you would find in Hawaii' but you got to remember you're in the middle of the desert. \n\nAhi Shoryu Poke - Tasted fresh with a slight soy sauce flavor?\n\nDempura? - Fish cakes, tasted just like that which you would get at a Korean restaurant, so if you like those, then you will definitely like this one.\n\nSpicy Combo Poke - The money of all pokes. The slight spicy kick is what really set this poke over the edge. Beware though as this poke is not \""light\"".\n\nRice w/ Furikake - At first I wasn't quite sure if I wanted rice, but after furikake was mentioned I had to get myself an order. For only $1.50 you get a pretty good amount of rice and the furikake adds exceptional taste.\n\nThe one thing that really made Poke Express was the great service. The owner was a nice Hawaiian man who really spent time to explain all the different types of poke and let us try EVERYTHING we wanted to try. He was very patient and definitely made the experience very pleasant for everyone. On top of that he could definitely hold down a good conversation.\n\nOverall: If you love poke than you will love Poke Express. We were enticed by the modern decor. And also the much longer wait at the buffet in the hotel. \n\nThe staff was unprofessional. They took a while to take the order, and then they brought out the main dishes way before our appetizers ever arrived. No one came by for a drink refill etc. \n\nThe food itself was meh.

There were no exclusions listed on the advertisement and there was not a single asterisk on the statement indicating exclusions. I asked the sales clerk to match the price of a protein powder also stocked by the online retailer vitacost. The sales clerk reviewed the flyer, nervously shuffled his feet, staring at the ground for a few minutes. Finally, I asked again if he could match the price as advertised in the company flyer. He told me that he could not and that the flyer was false. Out of sheer principle, I asked him to check with his manager. He disappeared to the back room of the store and returned a while later to tell me that the manager could only match the price if a retail store existed for the online retailer (of course, the ad stated nothing about this claim, yet nonetheless, the sales clerk looked up vitacost and found that a retail store did, in fact, exist in the US.) He returned to the back room to speak with his manager who supposedly called corporate to discuss the matter and returned shrugging his shoulders, avoiding any eye contact with me and scribbling with his pen on the flyer. At this point, I asked to personally speak with his manager because I felt that a company who advertises a claim should honor it. I can only assume that the manager refused to speak with me since he/she never appeared despite the sales clerk returning yet again to the back room to converse with him/her. The end result was that the sales clerk would not honor the ad claim in what I've deemed the greatest display of unprofessionalism I've ever experienced.

Make a person mad because you didn't cater to their every whim and they will slam you. Make a hundred people happy and maybe one will praise you. Well, I'm here to praise Zikwid. I've been in there probably ten times and never had an issue. I've also sent them a lot of business from all the people who ask me about my E-vic battery. I think the only thing remotely negative that I could say about them isn they weren't open when I went there at 8am on the way to work. But, that also probably not ideal vaping hours ha! As far as their price goes the Zikwid brand juice isn't a garage concoction juice (yes I've had people sell me juice that they made in their garage...) So I don't mind paying $26 for a thirty mil of Zen Berry. Because I know I'm getting quality juice. When I was a smoker I also wouldn't buy cigarettes from crack heads in alleys... Weird! To anyone reading this I suggest you actually go in and check the place out. Don't be tricked by temperamental children who would probably write a yelp review on their parents claiming they were abused because they didn't get a pony for their birthday. I will end this review by assuring you I have no involvement with this company except being completely impressed with the quality of their product and outstanding customer service. I arrived for a simple pedi/mani, everyone was friendly but the end result was horrible. I picked 2 different colors one for my toes and one for my fingernails. When I got home, every single one of my fingernails were lumpy, what seemed like air bubbles, and my toe nails didn't have an even coat of nail polish. \nThe next day I went back and the nail artist decided to give me multiple reasons why the nail polish was lumpy, instead of just apologizing. I ended up asking for a simple French tip with clear coat.\nAnd to sum up my experience, once the French mani was complete, the reasoning for the lumpiness was their clear top coat.\nNever coming back here !",2,concat

He answered every questions and offered suggestions and did not hesitate to supply samples of the moonshine and beer. \n\nUpon sampling the apple pie moonshine, my taste buds went into overload; it was incredible! yet a bit on the sweet side for me, but the bartender easily fixed this by mixing in some of the original moonshine. They offer a great variety of beers on tap as well.\n\nI ordered the brisket taco and pork belly taco, each $3 on the happy hour menu, and my boyfriend had the smoked turkey breast. The smoked turkey breast was delicious, but we would both recommend trying the BBQ at this place. The smell alone outside the establishment will get your mouth watering. The meat on the tacos was extremely tender and flavorful; melt-in-your-mouth quality. The coleslaw was also extremely fresh, crunchy, and packed great flavor.\n\nThe restaurant has a great atmosphere and the decor is upscale industrial  steampunk/western. I will definitely be returning and highly recommend this place to anyone who loves and appreciates true BBQ and a good drink! Ewww, the food here is terrible.  Nothing I had tasted good.

OMG...it was painful. Oh, we did get one dance song in there! This was such a turn off I decided to not take the class the remaining days of my stay.  Instructor was good, but this is Vegas, the party should continue all the way to the cycle studio.",2,concat

Yes, like some of the other reviews I read, it was late in the afternoon on a Sunday and it was completely empty. But the great staff and good food will keep me  coming back. I had the quarter chicken, all white meat, rice, and hummus. The seasoning on the chicken was very good and the skin is my favorite part of chicken so I would definitely choose this place over el pollo loco any day. Then top it off with that yummy garlic sauce, aww man I was such a happy camper! The rice was ok and so was the hummus, not to die for but who am I kidding? This ain't fine dining! I will definitely come back and be a regular here. PLEASE READ MY REVIEW ALL YELPERS.\n\nNow i got your attention. I will point out 5 things you will encounter on this event ( I am saving you next year). Each point are 1 star off the rating. Which means I would give 0 star if I can on this event. \n\nFirst is the ridiculous parking. I mean I have gone to alot of state fair, alot of other events that have tons of parking problems but this is one of the worst parking ever. \n\nSecond the execution. There are so much potential but all ends up being a failure. When we got there, the cooking event was cancel on one hour 1 pm i think. The chef cancelled and the people end up just roaming around. The eating contest is host by a boring lady. The band that the lady keep on saying is \"" worth the penny you pay\"" is nothing but a bunch of teenagers singing loudly, out of tone out of rhyme on the mic.\n\nThere are alot of lines. I mean it. Its like going to Disney Land but instead of ending up on the line and enjoying your ride, you will either have to pay for a sample or pay for the most expensive one bite burger you ever had. There is so much line I have to wait 1 hour and 20 minutes to make a order on one of the truck. Thats under the sun, on a sandy part of the event. There is limited shade and sittings is so lacking. Never again.\n\nFourth is the limitation of menus. So you know a truck here? and want their best food to offer? Well guess what, they might not have that on the menu. Most of the Truck have only 3-4 dishes to pick on. One truck in particular have 2 mini burgers, I mean mini, smaller than the fist of my niece. NO JOKE. As for the taste, we have taste more, and mind you we tried alot of this trucks, and there are more places in PHOENIX alone that offer better on taste, on portion, and obviously on PRICE!!!!!!!!!\n\nFifth and maybe the WORST thing ever about this event. The money you will spend in this event is ridiculous. There is the entrance fee, then there is payment for small portion of samples? THE F? ( costco have bigger portion and they dont freaking make you pay for samples) Water cost is 2 dollars. The cost for desserts will land you from 4-6 dollars. The main course foods which may I say are in small portions ( state fair have bigger portions ) are priced at minimum at 8-16 dollars.\n\nSo lets recap:\n12 + 2 + 4 + 2 +8 = 28 dollars for one head ( this is when u decide one sample, one drink, one dessert)\n\nFor 28 dollars we all know you could have gone and go to a upscaled restaurant and even gave a tip. Also thats just one bite. What happens in dinner? another 16- 30 dollars of food? \n\n\nFor my last note, the advertisement on this event are all false, all of the reviews are probably done by someone who works there. No one in their right mind would like to buy a small cupcake for 8 dollars. Also the token system dont make sense, each token is worth 2 dollars, you pay 2 dollars but whats the worth of this inside? 2 dollars!!!! What? why even have another currency (token) when there is no advantage for the patrons on doing so? \n\nThis event made me realize that not all the reviews on websites are not true. Oh and they changed their name thats why I wasnt able to find it on yelp, It was previously named Food Truck Festival (last review was on 2012).\n\nPlease I would never want you to go through what I and my family went through. This is a money grabbing event. Your way better off going to state fair. Better yet save it for a good restaurant.",2,concat

This last weekend, I had a big work weekend to prepare for and on the Monday before my lower back \""went out\"" and left me struggling to even stand upright or get out of a seated position.  I was relieved that Rob Tinnen was able to fit me in his schedule several times beforehand, and by the weekend I was able to do the physical work I had to do.  Not only that, but his work on my back had helped to the point where doing that physical work did not leave me back where I started, but continued to help heal my injury.\n\nThey take a well-rounded approach making gentle, effective adjustments, using heat, electro-stim, ultrasound, and lift tables.  Rob has suggestions for helpful diet choices, supplements, and exercises to aid the healing.  \nDr. Tinnen is also observant and respectful of what you personally want to get out of your visit.  I am not a fan of having people observe me and watch me exercise, he noticed this and makes suggestions for what I can try at home rather than push me to do what makes me uncomfortable.  I appreciate being able to make decisions like that about my health care.  All in all, this is comfortable and professional, great chiropractic care.  Check it out! I can't say anything about the food/drinks(as we never got to order any), but the service here was by FAR the worst I've ever had. I went with a group of people, and we were seated outside. This was understandable, as they were busy, but we had planned on staying for a while. I figured asking to be moved inside when they had open space wouldn't be a problem. I was wrong. After waiting over 15 minutes from initially being seated, the waiter finally comes around. I asked him to be put on a waiting list to be moved inside. He very snobbishly tells us we probably can't, but he would ask. Another 15 minutes later another employee comes by and basically tells us there's no guarantees of us being able to move inside... yet I saw many open tables that they placed other people at. The group I was with and I decided to leave before even placing an order. I don't care how good people claim the food and drinks are here I will NEVER come back.",2,concat

From your basic tuna rolls to your fancier hand rolls and specialties, I've not had anything I didn't want more of. The second-best sushi I've ever had. \n\nHowever, what makes this place shine is how good everything ELSE tastes! Too often, people thing Japanese = sushi. From the simple miso soup and house salad (which were far above others I've had) to the various platters, each dish tastes like a delicacy. The steak and chicken teriyaki are delicious choices that satisfy the more timid palate, and the various hot dishes that arrive on platters are all also excellent. Even the desserts, though simple, are excellent. I recommend the anjou pear poached in plum wine. \n\nThe downsides of this place are parking ($), price ($$$), and interior. Being in Station Square, you'll likely have to pay to park. The portions are not large for the money, which means you'll spend even more to be full. I expect to spend upwards of $70 for two when I come here. Also, the inside is plain and somewhat dated, which doesn't attract me. \n\nHowever, the incredible preparation and taste of the food here have kept me coming back any time I can afford a fancy meal!

After a few months when my wife was at 36 weeks, we had a feeling that this place is kind of sketchy since the past few appointments were quite weird.

He wanted to plug in a camera outside (which is easier for him, but easy for a criminal to unplug) and then actually raised his voice to my electrician and argued when my electrician said he could hardwire the camera from inside.\n3.  The technician who visited was one of the pushiest, most unprofessional people I have ever met.

He did not leave until both my neighbor and my electrician came to interrupt the conversation.\n4.  When I asked for a written quote the technician flipped over a used piece of paper and scribbled a few things in illegible handwriting and gave it to me.  That was the quote??!\n5.  When I called the technician's boss he asked why I couldn't make a decision without consulting my \""techie friend\"" (my licensed electrician who I was paying thousands of dollars to rewire the entire 82 year old house).\n6.  I called the company to file a formal complaint and the representative on the phone told me he's been doing this for 10 years and \""does not get these types of calls\"" but did not apologize.  He also refused to give me a quote in writing.  I'm sorry but I refuse to sign any contract or authorize any service until I see something in writing.\n\nSo, that's my story.

When we were sat & I ordered Champagne they said \""There is no champagne.\"" This is after paying over $100 for 3 adults & 2 minors. The waiter said they were out...\"" no more\"". I Then asked the front entrance staff who said champagne ends at 4pm. The HUGE sign in the front of the Buffet ALSO said Mother's Day  Champagne Brunch...all day. I then asked yo speak to a manager. ..told him my issue..he walked up to the huge sign & said. ..\""Champagne ends at 4.\""  The sign is wrong. It ALWAYS ENDES AT 4\"". I then pointed out that it was a HOLIDAY/MOTHERS DAY & told him I had called ahead as well, and was told \""Mother's Day Champagne Brunch all day...he wanted to know THE NAME of who I talked to. Then he was making up excuses as he went. \n           1. IT'S 17.99 ANYWAY\n           2. THE CHAMPAGNE IS \n               COMPLIMENTARY..NOT INCLUDED\n               IN THE PRICE.

The food was s 4 out of 10. The selection 3 out of 10. The waiters & waitresses are the best thing about this place.  But something tells me from the way we were treated that they probably aren't treated great either. Bottom line here. I got 2 glasses of Champagne that were very readonable & tasted for good $ 3.74 each.....BUT it's the point that they advertise one thing...get you there and then say. ..basically. ..YES, WE MADE S MISTAKE,  WE ARE NOT GOING TO MAKE IT RIGHT & TO BAD!

Anyway, onward with the review.\n\nThe suites are very luxurious and I can't find much to complain about, other than the bathtub being slightly too small and the toilet area being a little bit creepy (it's very small and there's a mirror inside). The suite is divided into a living room portion and a bedroom portion, both of which are equipped with LCD TVs for your entertainment. The living room area has a huge couch, coffee table, and dining table for you and your guests to drink and chat over. In the interest of time, we had two of our meals there and amused ourselves by drinking bottled water out of fancy wine glasses. Classy. My only other complaint is that the overall layout of it is a bit nonsensical to me, as the bedroom is located closer to the entrance while the living room is in the back. \n\nThe service and staff are top-notch. I had two major issues during my stay here (neither of which are the hotel's fault) and they were quickly resolved. Issue #1: The suite they initially gave us smelled like weed. I called the front desk and they immediately moved me to a new room. Issue #2: Drunken woman mistakenly tries to enter my room at 4:00am. She bangs on the door when the key doesn't work and wakes me up. I call security and she is escorted back to her room down the hall. They are very professional and very respectful toward their patrons. I would recommend this place to anyone if they don't mind walking a bit to get to the hotspots on the strip.\n\n*update*\nAfter staying at a few other places and paying similar prices, I've decided to upgrade this place to 5-star based on the value. No reason why I should pay $100 per night for a hotel room when $50 more can get me a luxurious suite. Today is the worst experience I've had here. The food quality has been going downhill steadily, along with the quality of the help. Sure, there are still the great few employees that work here, but the increase in price (doubled since they've opened) and cut crab legs really are the points why I do not recommend this buffet anymore to visiting guests. \nThe employees ignore you while you wait for something just out of reach, then help people who cut in line while you've been waiting to get their attention. \nThe feel is they got popular really fast, got arrogant, and now it's being reflected in the overall dining experience. \nThis place was great the first 2-3 years of opening.  Recently, not so much. \nPity.",2,concat

They only do tires, so there's no suggested sell BS (\""oh, we checked your brake pads and they look thin...\"")\n\nI'm the kind of guy who is picky about tires - I do the research before I go in, and know exactly what I want before I go in. Their website confirmed they had the tires I wanted in stock. I called, they said no appointment necessary, come on down. Was in and out in a half hour. Did the same with tires on my wife's car. Paid a little more for the \""no questions asked\"" warranty (which I've gotten bitten on at Tires Plus before for not getting) I have never come close to being in and out of Tires Plus in half hour.

Read on if you are curious...\n\nI have been dealing with Gold's Gym at least 3 times a week.. at certain points it was every single day...since I found out they didn't actually cancel my account.\n\nI was reimbursed for the $50 they charged me as a \""rate guarantee fee\"" that the sales man agreed to wave (which obviously was a huge lie). Then my account was charged AGAIN after I was told my account was cancelled (for probably the 6th time). The salesman asked me to come down and pick up the cash again but I had just been there 2 days prior and it is not at all a quick commute. I asked him to mail it, provided my new address, and he repeated it to me. A week or more goes by and I have no gotten it. Turns out he sent it to the wrong apartment number. He apologizes and says he will send it out ASAP. Then another 2 or so weeks goes by and I'm furious and it turns out he sent it to the completely wrong address. My OLD address from where I moved AWAY from (the reason I wanted to cancel in the first place!). Then I call him, give him my address AGAIN and have him repeat it to me. This was about a week ago and I still have not gotten the money.\n\nToday I get a call from their outside billing company and they tell me that I am still in their account (despite Gold's Gym telling me that they have completely taken me out) and they are planning on sending me to collections if I don't pay what is overdue as well as a cancellation fee if I still want to cancel).\n\nSo... Gold's wants me to pay them for a gym membership that I cannot even use. And they want me to continue to pay for this for another 9 months. \n\nHow do these people sleep at night?",2,concat

The pork was awesome. I've tried many of the highly-rated taco places around, and this pork is now rated among the best. In part, this is because it was finely shredded and very easy to eat. No big chunks falling out all over.\n\nThe shrimp taco was the most disappointing of the lot--the hot sauce overwhelmed any other flavor, even though it didn't have much of a kick. Even so, it was quite edible, and much better than tacos at other places.\n\nI LOVED the vegetable taco. The texture was perfection--crisp, with lots of flavor.\n\nFor my free side, I got a house side salad with a chipotle vinaigrette (I think).

They literally cooked my hair, and I lost 6 inches of it! I went to a different place on the next day and all the hairstylists were terrified with what happened to my hair and said they had never seen worse job in their lives.

Not only that, but when I called they said it would cost $60, I ended up paying $150! I asked for a refund and they gave it to me right away, but they can never give me my hair back or all the money I had to spend at the new salon and with all the products I have to use it now to fix what they did.

A huge comfy bed, well lit room,  blackout curtains, a vast standing shower with large shower head, and the cutest little retro clock.

I hunted around for a good deal and a good spa, and settled on the PH spa.  I had this whole plan to surprise her and everything.

I informed the guy that my massage was supposed to start 5 minutes ago, and he said \""You need to wait in the lounge.\""  Five minutes later, the massage therapist came to get me.\n\nHands down, she was amazing!  We paid for Swedish massage, but I asked if she could do some deep tissue on some areas and she happily obliged. \n\nNow this is the WORST PART.  After my massage, I went to go pay (at this point I had NO IDEA my mother had already paid for them), and they happily took my cash.

It sits at the head of an executive office complex. Attending a Research Chefs convention and needed to find the best of the best. Since I was with the\""meat group\"" I needed to find a good steakhouse that didn't let me down. This is it. Three of us had the bone in filet which is excellent. The bone in NY Strip and KC Strip are the same and my guest was somewhat disappointed. Had the seafood tower which they created for the 6 of us. Everyone had oysters, lobster tail, crab claws, king crab and jumbo shrimp. That would have been enough for dinner. Our top meathead had the bone in ribeye which is a hard to find item in many restaurants. Even for a guy from Kansas City. For sides we ordered the sauteed mushrooms and lobster mashed potatoes. Served family style. Dessert was amazing as well. Huge pieces of chocolate cake, 3 large scoops of ice cream and I had my usually Mexican coffee served with fresh whipped cream. And to top things off, at the bar we ran into some ball players there for spring training. My customer and I got a pic with Rickey Henderson which capped off the night. They drove us back to our downtown Phoenix hotel in their Escalade. Saw very good reviews on Yelp so decided to go there for one of my bachelorette pre-party dinners.

They answered a ton of questions I had and were genuinely honest.  I felt very comfortable immediately.  Super friendly and flexible as well.

Protein portion size is a deal-breaker for me.\n\nJust got takeout for lunch. Ordered a Spinach Salad with add-on shrimp. Discovered the policy for an add-on protein is ONE LARGE SHRIMP. Very disappointed. The manager told me their shrimp costs about $1.10 each. EACH. (That seems to be pretty high-priced shrimp, especially for a one-dollar-sign restaurant on Yelp.) The manager offered, if i returned, to \""give me another shrimp\"", as that, evidently, is a non-add-on portion of shrimp. Still disappointed.\n\nThe manager was nice, the service was pleasant, the food was fairly good and quick. (I found the shrimp to be nicely cooked, a little under-seasoned. The spinach salad was nothing to write home about, and the balsamic vinaigrette was not very punchy. My fiance loved his baked wheat pasta with meat sauce, which was well-seasoned and rich) \n\nMore info from the manager. Add-on portion of chicken is 3 oz (6 for entree). Add-on for meatballs is 2 balls. So I guess when you order the create-you-own pasta dish, you get less protein than when you order one of their \""classics\"".\n\nBeing a new restaurant, I was told \""they are still working out the kinks\"". Well, this is a HUGE kink for me, and I imagine it will be a kink for others. I hope that the policy changes, because the food is good, and I wish the company success (I would love to have quick/cheap Nora's around the corner when I want pasta!)\n\nUPDATE: I also went to their website and submitted a complaint. I received an email the same day from the founder/owner saying \""Thank you so much for your interest in us and I assure you the shrimp policy will be changed first thing in the morning!! I'm sure you know that this was only our second day being open, and we are trying really hard to offer a top quality quick serve pasta concept.\""\n\nSo they get another star from me, for being cool and understanding.

This place was rated highly on Yelp, and so a taxi-ride later ($20), we were there. Where \""there\"" is exactly is hard to say for us, and we had to look around to find the exact location of the place (it's in the middle \""island\"" building on the right). It's located right in the middle of some Korean restaurants, and is definitely not your standard \""strip\"" business - it's not at all notable from the outside.\n\nThe inside is another matter. We chose to sit at the bar to watch the itamae at work, but we liked the set up of the tables and the main room. I was immediately intrigued by the aquariums in the back that housed live flounder, prawns, and abalone. I inquired about the abalone (it wasn't on the menu), and was a bit taken aback at the price ($25), but ordered it anyway due to the fact that we were on vacation, and I couldn't recall ever seeing it on a menu before. It was fantastic - very nice, firm, texture and a very oceany- (almost uni-like) taste.\n\nI decided to have some of the prawn, too (also not on the menu), and was very pleased with that, too. They serve the prawn raw, first, and after you've had the tail, they then tempura-fry the head. It was extraordinary!\n\nWe had some other dishes, too: some of them ordered by us, and some of them presented to us by the owner (we ordered a few things that weren't in-stock, and I think it was a very nice and appreciated gesture). Everything we had, from start to finish, was just excellent: fresh tako, hamachi, and unagi sushi, and a HUGE \""special\"" maki roll. The sake was good, and reasonably priced too. I was so full by the end of the meal, I couldn't fit any uni, and that's a first for me!\n\nThe only (very minor) complaint I have is that they didn't have closed-captioning on the TV's. \n\nI highly recommend this place for anyone looking for a fantastic meal of sushi in Vegas..

The casino is stunning with marble floors and dark wood accents. I am glad Harrahs/Caesars decided to keep the long bar and the original chandeliers, because they add so much to the ambiance, and help retain some of the cherished past.\n\n...but more than the cosmetic changes, the modern, friendly, customer-oriented atmosphere is most noticeable!

What a great manager! His pride in The Cromwell is apparent!  Spoke with him again today, and handed him a comment card, reflecting much of what I am saying in this review.\n\nFrank, the slot attendant, came over a few minutes later and chatted. We saw him about an hour later at another slot machine, and he remembered us and made some suggestions to enhance our slot experience. Saw him again today, and observed him working to enhance another client's experience at The Cromwell!  And he remembered me from yesterday!

No more, those days are long behind me.\n\nThe combination of my disgust with Phoenix - really just a hotter, dryer version of LA -  and the unseemly politics of people like Sheriff Joe Arpaio and Governor Brewer have  pretty much taken me to the point where I don't plan to set foot (or spend another dollar) in that state.\n\nThis airport blows.  It's huge, if you rented a car it succeeds in outdistancing even Providence in terms of how far you must travel to get your vehicle.

It totally ruined it for everyone else, and a massive, swear-filled argument ensued afterwards, which even resulted in us getting torrents of abuse from a couple of 10 year old kids who'd joined our game.\n\nIt still makes me laugh to this day.

Also, no ridiculous fees for pithy shit like ordering online or using a credit card  like the ones Gus's tacks on to their bill. A big plus. One oddity, the quoted delivery time is nearly two hours away, but when I get my confirmation email it seems that their whole system is an hour ahead so I don't have to hold back the munchie demons until damn near 3am.

She ran to get the head nurse because I bled all over my bed...the fear was that there may be an infection because of what he had done.  It caused me to ruin my furniture when I got home because I wouldnt stop bleeding/draining. My bed and coutch were ruined. While I was at the hospital, When I needed a nurse I would push the button...but rarely did they come when I called, I learned that if I crawled out of bed to the bathroom, there was an emergency button there that I could push and they would come running..   The nurses are overworked and hostile..the environment is non caring...I was treated as if I was an inconvenience. I was not treated as a person who just had MAJOR surgery, I was treated as if I was a 3 day stay at a cheap hotel.  The cleaning staff went through my things when they thought I was asleep, they even sat and watched TV.  The nurse who took me off my drip, forgot to put me in manually for my pain medicine every few hours, by that afternoon I was in sooooo much pain.  The head nurse and the AM nurse argued in my room over this.  My surgery was lumbar fusion, so I was cut on the front and back sides of me...it was painful to say the least.  I got my morning pain medicine at 8am, and got my next dose manually that evening.  it was horrible. Lets talk about food.  When laying in a bed, if there is a tray put on the rolling tray holder you cannot see it.  Some Blonde with a major attitude the 1st morning after my surgery walked into my room and and quipped \""Oh, not hungry or are we just on a fat loss regime today?\""  I was not at all happy with her comments, 1st of all, I didn't even know food was up there, no one told me food had arrived...because of my oxygen tube I couldn't smell. She had no right to make a rude comment which made me feel Fatter than I already am... later that afternoon more food came, she just dropped it on the rolling tray holder, then pushed it away against the wall while she straightened up...then left!  I pushed the nurses button for over an hour, finally when they arrived the nurse brought over the tray.  COLD mush is NOT an option...COLD coffee..no offer to get fresh food...I ended up not eaying till 2 days after my surgery...The STAFF does NOT care!  I wrote a detailed letter to the CEO, Head Nurse and the hospital administrator after I got home.  The CEO responded back to me a few weeks later apologizing and saying he will make sure there is more training for the nurses and staff. That's it??  Never offering to replace my furniture, or asking me what the hospital could do to make things better for me.  \nNow a few months later, I am healing, but I have no job to look forward to returning to because my FMLA ended too soon for me.

We reserved a room with 2 queen beds and the room was clean, spacious and beds very comfortable. We went down to the pool, kids wanted to check out lazy river. Apparently the $28 resort fee does not include rafts, you have to rent them. In the 3 hours I was down there not once did a cocktail waitress ask if I wanted something to drink. Went to bar only to be told cash only, they're credit card machine wasn't working and no room charges either. Avenue 24 is ridiculously expensive for breakfast, eat out or try Starbucks. The monorail is $5.00 one way per person or $12.00 round trip. It was cheaper for the 4 of us to take a cab than to take the monorail. I noticed a lot of women looking to solicitate, not one staff member seemed to care. Definitely will stay someplace else next time.",2,concat

As good as it gets!\"" - IN ARIZONA\n\nBeing that my Thai grandmother's blood runs through my veins, and it's all I had growing up at home, I'd like to say that I'm a pretty credible Thai food yelper.  For the past MANY years, this is the only Thai restaurant that my parents will dine in. \n\nTheir menu is pretty eclectic since they offer everything from stir-fried noodles, noodle soups, stir-fried meat/veggie dishes, and fried rice. I had the pad Thai the last time I went to pick up take-out about 3 weeks ago. It was WAY spicy, but I asked for it. Despite the streams of sweat that were rolling down my temples, the noodles were delicious! My other favorite dish here is the pad kee mao which translates into stir fried drunkard. This dish is best spicy as well. I highly recommend this place if you're in the area and love authentic Thai food. My boyfriend works in this shopping center and he likes deli food so I went to vons to get him some cheap bean and cheese burritos in the deli section- I was going to get a fresh sandwich made because I am not totally into the fried deli food and the menu actually looked pretty good--- turkey pesto something I don't remember.  ANYWAYS. I was standing at the counter watching the two employees do EVERYTHING but their job in helping me. Like literally probably close to 5 minutes \n\nPretty upset and annoyed I called my boyfriend and he told me that this was \""pretty typical\"" and that ordering food from the deli section seemed to be a HUGE inconvenience for them.

Today I waited in the drive thru line literally 10 minutes - and there was only ONE car ahead of me!  That was just after 11:00 am.  The sign advertises on price but every time I go they charge me a different price when I get to the window!  Today I was not having it, I was only paying for what the sign on the price advertised.  $4.49 for the Mango Magic smoothies and 99 cents for whey protein.  Somehow they calculate this to be $6.30!  THAT is the most I've ever been charged. The idiot guy at the window said well that is the price and I argued with him and said well the sign says something else and I'm only paying what the sign says!  He got what he called was his manager, some young girl who was just as rude as him and said well they changed the prices yesterday.  Ok well, thats not my problem.  The price on the sign says this and that is all I\""m paying... she continued to argue with me. At this point I should have just drove off.  But she said she's give me a discount.  I don't want a discount, I only want to pay what the sigh says.  So long story short I paid $5.18 .  That is LESS than what the sign says... but whatever, I paid it and got out of there.  Needless to say, I will NEVER use this location again, that was the last straw!  The only good thing I can say is that the smoothie was blended well and tasted good.  As for service and courtesy of the staff, I'd give that a ZERO stars if I could it was that bad, and its consistently that bad, this isn't a one time occurrence, which is why I'm finally writing a review!

He offered deal after deal, which we turned down. Then he finally arrived at the deal that we \""could not turn down\"". So we drove off in our new to us car and left our old car behind.  After a week, we had not heard anything so we stopped by to see what was up. Then Cassidy said they could not find a financing option for the deal he proposed and we all signed, so he wanted his car back.  OK,  how can you come up with a deal and then after 1 week decide that it just isn't going to work and then ask for the car back!!!  WTF!  The dealership should know what is going to fly or not.

(It's pricey, so unfortunately it can't be a weekly (or daily) event as much as I would like it to be.) I'm trying really hard not to be harsh. Honest. But this place has so many negatives and so few positives.\nMany of the reviews here mention the noise. They just don't give enough bad credit to the soundproofing.  This place is horrid for sleeping.  I stayed here Memorial weekend. The room was clean but certainly not elaborately decorated. Needed more towels. Bathroom so-so. Nothing about the room or property decor stated \""upscale\"" or \""resort\"".\nPool needs more lounge chairs, they were all hoarded and taken very early in the day. Misters would be a small but welcome addition to the Oasis bar by the pool. The Oasis bar was frequently understaffed. The poor person stuck there, \""Jaimie\"" was very pleasant but overwhelmed by the work load.  The concierge in the lobby was flat rude to several folks on situations I eavesdropped on. Front desk on check in was nothing special.\nBack to the noise....Walking down the hallway rooms 160's, 170's, etc., my friends and i could and did stop and listen to any number of conversations thru the closed doors. Mind you this was standing in mid-hall, not up against door. Amazed at how poor the soundproofing. At night the place was a crashbox of noise. Simply unacceptable on any level. And certainly poor for a Resort/Spa property.\nMy comments to the front desk regarding noise were treated as, \"" Ho-Hum. Heard it all before. \""\nWhen asked about Phoenix by coworkers and friends I'll have too, in good manners, steer them far away from this facility. Which is a shame. There is no way I can recommend this place at all. Too many fine properties, good pools, and nice staff at facilities in Phoenix area. \nThis is definitely not one of them.",2,concat

I had out of town guests visiting, and we wanted some ice cream after our dinner. We were in the general area, and I had heard so many good things about Mary Coyles, that I suggested we try it out. My friends were impressed with the appearance of the place when we got there. It was about 815pm on Sunday night. The place was reasonably busy. After looking at the menues, We decided on a \""Peak\"" which was listed as three flavors of ice cream with three different sauces for each scoop, and a simple sundae of Peppermint Bark Icecream with hot fudge. \n\nAfter waiting quite a while, our ice cream arrived. First shock--the Peak came in a tumbler, not in a boat or bowl. so it was three scoops of icecream (all different flavors) on top of one another, with the sauces all mixed in. To make matters worse, it was melted, so more like a milkshake instead of sundae. My peppermint bark sundae was also melted and mushy.  The three of us ate maybe half of the sundaes. When the waitress came around to check on us, we let her know that we were disapointed in both the presentation of the Peak, and the fact that both items were melty and runny. She offered to have them remade, but by this time, we just wanted to leave. She presented the bill with a 10% discount.. Woopty doo...No visit from a manager, no offer to take care of us next time... just a \""here is your $1.25 off\"". So we ended up paying something like $12 for two runny, melted dishes (glasses really) of ice cream.",2,concat

The chicken fell off the bone and we were licking our fingers wishing we had ordered more.\n\nFor mains I had king prawns with asparagus and black bean sauce with ginger rice. My boyfriend had king prawn tempura with a teriyaki sauce and chilli rice. The rices definitely complimented the dishes well, they were full of flavour.

I've eaten at Sushi Kame on several occasions, and I have overheard the hostess speak to the other staff in Japanese several times.  Although the owner's ethnicity might not be the sole indication of authenticity and quality, I certainly think Sushi Kame's menu provides sufficient evidence of the restaurant's potential.\n\nOn a winter night several months ago, I decided to stop into Sushi Kame for dinner.  Cold fish doesn't alleviate the chill in one's bones, but I thought that a hearty bowl of udon (noodle soup) might do the job.  As I took the menu from my waitress, I glanced at the list of daily specials and saw that sukiyaki was being served.  This wasn't the type of trendy, flashy food that readily pervades American culinary consciousness, but home-style Japanese comfort food.  When the waitress brought it out, I was surprised to see the slices of rare beef and shirataki noodles served in the traditional iron skillet used  to prepare this dish.  Like much of Japanese cuisine, the flavors of my dinner were simple and clean, but the meal was nevertheless hearty and perfect for winter.\n\nBecause other reviewers have already commented on the quality of sushi here, I will instead focus my review on some of the other dishes served at Sushi Kame.  My favorite appetizer to order at Sushi Kame is the agedashi tofu, several pieces of lightly-breaded soft tofu in a classic Japanese dressing (soy sauce, dashi, mirin, etc.).  If I have time to relax in the afternoon, I like to stop by and order one of their lunch bento boxes, which are fantastic deals as you are given: an entree of your choice (usually some kind of teriyaki), white rice, a salad (pretty modest, made mostly with iceberg lettuce), several pieces of tempura (I'm delighted when I get a piece of Japanese pumpkin with mine), and a few pieces of sushi.  Meals also come with a small somen and cucumber salad (don't expect much; you can finish it in 2 bites) and miso soup (pretty standard).  I absolutely adore the teriyaki at Sushi Kame, a mix of grilled meat (or tofu) and vegetables, including carrots, onions, green beans, and HUGE, DELICIOUS pieces of teriyaki-flavored GARLIC!  I've also eaten the tonkatsu (Japanese fried pork chop), which is fairly simple and good enough for people who crave it.\n\nEveryone fosters a love for their own favorite Japanese town, and while Sushi Kame might not have the flair of KoFusion (with its dance club-inspired decor) or Kamakura (with its teppanyaki performances), I would recommend it as an elegant establishment that offers its own menu of worthy Japanese food. Wow... for once I wish Yelp had a rating lower than one star.\n\nWe decided on a trip last weekend to try a new place in Vegas, and after checking out the menu and a few reviews, Circo seemed like the place that fit the bill.\n\nWe arrived for our reservation, and were promptly seated at a table with a view of the fountains, as requested.  This was about the last time I even remember being satisfied at this restaurant.\n\nSeveral groups around us were served several times before our waiter ever returned to go over the menu.  It was about 15 minutes from the time we received our menus to anyone ever returning to our table.\n\nWe had informed the person we made the reservation with that we had a show to attend more than 2 hours after our reservation, but just wanted to ensure we had enough time.\n\nAfter the atrocious wait time for even a drink order, the waiter finally acknowledged our table and just asked if we were ready to order, failing to cover anything on the menu, give any sort of introduction, or talk about the chefs specials.  If this was standard for the restaurant I could understand, however we heard him give this introduction to every table seated after us that was nearby.\n\nI reminded him politely after taking my order that we did have a show to get to, and just making sure we could leave on time.  His reply was a dry \""We'll do what we can\"".\n\nOur food came in a reasonable amount of time after ordering, though It'd be hard for me to call it quickly... given the pace of the night so far, this was a bit uptempo.\n\nAfter finishing our meal and having our plates cleared, we waited another 15 minutes before our waiter returned.  He brought a special dessert for our friend whose birthday we were celebrating.  It was a nice touch, but just too little too late.  Also at this point, he failed to leave the check behind, even though I had told him we needed to be somewhere.\n\nFinally the check arrived, about 20 minutes before showtime... so we were forced to hurry out of the restaurant and on to the theatre.\n\nThe food itself was tasty, nothing to rave about, but adequate... although everyone felt the portions did not justify the price, except for the pizza.\n\nAfter a weekend of such pleasant experiences in a town that prides itself on service, it was literally heartbreaking to have such an awful evening in this restaurant.\n\nI know no one from our party will ever be back.",2,concat

I have to give this restaurant 1 star because of a single employee's lack of interest in doing her job. A friend and I went into the restaurant a few days ago to see if they were open for lunch. We saw a young woman working at the podium and asked if they were open. She was on the phone, looked at us, and held up 5 fingers. Not being sure if that meant to wait just a minute, we stood there and waited. After maybe 3 minutes, she showed no intention of helping us or even getting off the phone. She wouldn't even look at us as I made it clear that we were looking for the website to see if they were open. She was on the phone still, now laughing at the conversation. It sounded like a personal call. I asked once again \""so you guys aren't open?\"", and got completely ignored. So we left, not able to dine there since we weren't able to find out from them if or when they'd open. We could smell food cooking from outside, so we assumed they were open. After we left, we took our business to a nearby competing restaurant, and I had probably best steak I've ever had in my life there (Filetto Di Manzo Toscano at Brio Tuscan Grille). I recommend everyone try the steak there. The service is also far superior, as their employees aren't making personal phone calls and ignoring customers.  I would have liked to try Texas de Brazil, but honestly with such a bad first impression, it doesn't seem like it's worth it.\n\nThis happened on Tuesday, September 9th, around 12:35pm.

I went on a Saturday night- about 9pm... about half full of people  the bar top was full of used napkins, straws, and empty glasses with ice and drink remnants, and everything was wet. oh and fruit flies- (in Winter!) fruit flies, fruit flies!! Strike 1. \n\nBartenders- I sat at the bar for about 12 minutes before anyone came and asked if I wanted anything, offered a menu, or anything. When the sloppy dressed schlub did come over he said- \""What do you want?\"" (there is no uniform for employees- which is confusing for customers. No shirt that says Esquire or anything- just a guy. I ordered a Blue Moon... A freaking TAP beer. as easy as you can get- When he returned with it, he just placed it in front of me on the wet bar- no napkin/coaster, the beer was flat, and contained a FREAKING lemon. Not an orange- a lemon. Boo. (Flat beer usually means dirty pipes or an old keg!) He just asked for money- didn't ask if I wanted a tab, or if I was ordering food, offer a menu...(which was my intention, but was never offered) was never approached again- about 15 minutes, drank my beer- and met friends at a different bar. I was sitting in this place for 27 minutes- and spent under $5- if you had a good bar staff- that would have easily been about $20 with an app. and another beer- and I would have asked my friends to come to Esquire.... and they would have spent money too.  \nCustomer service was crap. Strike 2. \n\nThe Look- is mismatched, ply wood, random cheap bar decorations. That Screams Dive Bar. I don't know how much this bar makes- but they could easily stand to spend 2-3 grand and do a minor upgrades so that at least everything matches. extremely unappealing- so many better options on the same street!  Strike 3.  \n\nYeah- not going back. Clean your place before someone get's sick!",2,concat

I saw the positive reviews that other Yelpers had given and felt it was worth a shot.   I was not disappointed, I was actually quite impressed by the friendly service and the food was quite delicious.   Definitely try the pork, it is an absolute revelation, very tender and juicy with tremendous flavor, was certainly everything others have hyped it up to be.    Beyond that I tried a little of the pineapple chicken which was also quite tasty.

We had two waitresses and both of them were incredibly kind and down to Earth. Not like many places where you're made to feel like you're an inconvenience. We ate exclusively off the happy hour menu and were delighted with the prices. The food was so delicious!! Fresh and full of flavor...not greasy at all. The chips and curry appetizer was amazing! Unfortunately we were too full to even try any desserts. I had the Jasmine tea and it was heavenly! It was the perfect temperature. We couldn't get enough so our waitress kindly brought us a cup to go. Oh, and don't miss out on the Poutine! Recently, my husband and I made a trip to Las Vegas. Since we are huge fans of Gordon Ramsay, we made reservations at his \""Gordon Ramsay Steak\"" restaurant, in the Paris hotel. \n \nMy husband wrote a great review of our experience but it wouldn't fit here.  So this is the condensed version.  We had a reservation on a Thursday night for 8:15.  We arrived on time and were told by the woman in front that it would be 10-15 minutes.  Go wait in the bar.  No I'm sorry, nothing, not even a smile when we walked up to her.  We were later told by a manager her name was Danielle.\n\nWe went into the bar and it was packed and had to stand.  15 minutes later a couple that had an 8:15 reservation left and we took their seats and ordered a drink.  My husband went to check with Danielle who held up her hand in an impatient \""stop talking\"" manner,  and informed my husband \""You are the next to be seated\"". Then immediately turned her back on him.\n\nThen the people next to us who had an 8:30 reservation were seated.  I got up to talk to Danielle who was quite rude to me as well and informed me that \""someone\"" was in there looking for us.  Apparently when you arrive Danielle writes down what you look like and when it's your turn to be seated she gives your description to a young girl who has to come in an find you.\n\nFinally a young girl got us, at 9:00 for an 8:15 reservation.   I'm sure Danielle had forgotten about us and couldn't be bothered to apologize for her error.  We told the young woman you got us how displeased we were.  She had nothing to say and looked very uncomfortable.  We were seated and at this point I told my husband I just wanted to pay for our drinks and talk to the manager.  The waiter came and we told him, he apologized, first person to do so.  Then another man came up we told him the whole story, nope he was not the manager.  Finally the manager came up and by this time we were really upset.  He offered us a table near the kitchen.  There was no way I was going to spend several hundred dollars on dinner.  We had to repeat we just wanted our check, he comped us for the drinks.\n\nSo be aware, reservations mean nothing at GR Steak. We watch all of Gordan's shows, he always preaches STANDARDS.  Apparently he needs to teach some to Danielle and the hostesses of GR steak.",2,concat

I relegated myself to sit by a wobbly-looking display with outdated products, hoping I'd be left alone to wait out my sentence.\n\nI have rarely seen the likes of the despair that I saw in my two hours of waiting in the Verizon store.

When I moved here I tried multiple barbers and no one could consistently get my haircut right.\nAt who's next I can go in and have the piece of mind that no matter which barber cuts my hair they will take their time and do it right ! I use the jcrew hair products and it's hard to find that stuff at a good price and they always have it in stock. I now call ahead to make and appt. and request Alex he is the best. Atmosphere wise it is good also they have flat screen tvs for each chair and a big flat screen on the wall.You can go to the barbershop watch the game and have good conversation with the customers and even have a beer which reminds me of back home! Don't waste your money anywhere else and go check this place out - I don't normally write reviews but this place is well deserving of one Purchased a LocalDine and was anxious to try the place.

The best, most unique hamburger & fried onion place period I booked a 3-day rental car for $81.XX and I had my colleague rent the car on the 1st day because I wasn't flying into LV until the day after.  There was a little problem because my colleague is only 24 years old, and he doesn't meet the 25+ rule.  So, for everyday, we have to pay an extra $14 because of that, which I totally understand.   BUT, now all of a sudden, the $81 turned into almost $260!  \n\nSo at this time, my coworker is already in LV at Fox, and I'm still in LA.  He has no mode of transportation to the hotel and CES Intl trade show, so I'm worried about him now since I have to make sure he's taken care of until I get there.\n\nSo I called and talked to GEORGE (Fox worker) because he was the one helping my coworker out.  I  called in, so I obviously initiated the conversation about the issue, so I obviously have the \""right of way\"" of talking.  But he kept cutting me off while I'm addressing the issue, but I kept talking over him.  Then he flips the script on me, and tells me, \""Stop interrupting me, or else I will not talk to you and I will hang up.\""  Then I told him, \""You're interrupting me, I called in, I'm the customer, let me speak and address what I have to say, can you stop interrupting ME? Let me talk first since I initiated the conversation\"".  Then he keeps warning me, \""If you don't let me talk, I will not talk to you and hang up.\"" So then, I ask to speak to a manager or supervisor, and he then tells me, \""There are no managers/supervisors here\"", then he hangs up.\n\n(This part I wasn't there, but my coworkers filled me in after) George tells my coworker to rent a car for $40/day just for today, then when I get there tomorrow, I will put it back under my name, so this way, we won't get charged too much.  So my coworkers agrees.  Then George said that he has no credit, so he can't rent a car, even though he has money in his ATM/Debit card with a Visa/MC logo.  So George denied my coworker the car.  That was that.  End of story for now. (No other options were given) So at this point, he's stuck at Fox, and I'm still in LA, and can't really do nothing about it.  I'm over 4 hours away trying to figure out what to do. The only thing I could do is to call corporate.\n\nSo I called Fox Rent A Car corporate office to talk to HR and I explained the situation. The lady was nice enough to transfer me to the GM at the LV location.  (Wait! I thought there were no managers or supervisors that I can speak to, GEORGE!  You liar!)\n\nSo I got in touch with Alfonzo Ruiz, the GM over at Fox LV.  I explained the situation, and he apologized and he said he will take care of my coworker thats been waiting there since he got there, over 3 hours!  Alfonzo informed me that if someone doesn't have good credit or any credit, the only way around it so that my coworker can rent a car is if he provides a return airline ticket/itinerary (Which he has).   This option was never told to my coworker, and all this could have been avoided.\n\nI had to call Fox Rent A Car corporate office to get a hold of a GM at the LV location because George didn't want to transfer me to the GM, stating that there are no manager or supervisors there.  Soon as I talked to Alfonzo, he straightened everything out on a phone call that took no more than 2 minutes!  \n\nGEORGE @ Fox Rental Car LV - Here are some tips for you:\n\n1.) CUSTOMER IS ALWAYS RIGHT! \n2.) TREAT CUSTOMERS WITH RESPECT! \n3.) DON'T THREATEN TO HANG UP!\n4.)  When a customer wants to talk to a supervisor, they have every right to!  NEVER SAY THERE IS NO MANAGER OR SUPERVISOR.  ALMOST EVERY BUSINESS HAS ONE! \n\n-------------END OF REVIEW FOR THIS INCIDENT--------------\n\n-------------Another incident from 3 months ago------------------\n\nAnother incident, I was at this same location about 3 months ago.  There were about 6-7 workers (possibly including a supervisor), I was the 3rd party in line.  There were 3 parties being helped at the desk, and it was taking for ever.  After 35-45 minutes goes by, the line is now 8-9 parties long, and the original 3 parties already being help, were still being helped!  Talk about slow service!\n\nThere were about 3-4 workers that were just standing by talking to each other.  They completely ignored the long line.  I felt sorry for the people behind us in line.  There were open stations or computers and they could have easily helped the line go faster only if they actually WORKED, instead of standing around talking to each other, going to the back room, etc.\n\nVERY SLOW SERVICE HERE!  I let this one slide and I didn't post up a review, but after today's incident, I just had to.  I'm never renting a car at this location every again.  All Fox Rent A Car locations have LESS than 3 stars!  \n\nNOTE TO CORPORATE:  Implement some training for customer service, work ethics, behavior, etc.  PLEASE!  At least TRY!  Because it definitely doesn't look like Fox Rent A Car cares about consumer reviews, customer service, etc.",2,concat

Born in Jamaica's Hedonism 3 resort I regularly feasted on jerk chicken, rice, and plantains. While I have managed well over the past couple of years to keep VH under control, I did have a hankering for Caribbean food this weekend and found A Taste of the Caribbean at Baseline & Mill. I could feel Vanilla Heat fighting to get out.\n\nFrom my table I could hear the sizzle from the chicken as it cooked and I began looking forward to its arrival. While waiting I looked at my mobile app and saw several Yelp reviews and the only negative thing I really saw was the level of spice. I am not sure if the owners made a change, but the jerk chicken was spicy on my visit. The chicken was fall-off-the-bone tender and had an excellent flavor. It came with a side of red beans & rice, cabbage, and 3 plantains. The owner told me if I needed more rice, cabbage, or plantains to ask him.\n\nThe restaurant is small and colorful with very pleasant decorations, and Pandora played nice reggae rhythms. This restaurant took me back to my trip to Jamaica and provided the best jerk chicken I have had since.

They constantly change their marketing/incentive programs, and refuse to honor what they had in place before.

So, we paid for 6 haircuts with the promise of a free one in return, and now.... nothing.  I asked for the owner's contact info, which they wouldn't give me.  They took my name and number instead and promised to get back to me.

This was our first time going to this place so I didn't have any preconceived notions about it. This was not just a dinner but this was a celebration dinner for my husband. I made reservations for 19 almost a week before the date of the dinner. I was told that this wouldn't be a problem and to confirm my appt the day before. I actually spoke with about 3 different ppl during that week and everyone still said everything was fine. \n\nWhen I got to the restaurant with my party we walked back to our table and it was 2 separate tables with our backs to the next table. If you have ever booked a dinner for family and friends, you would assume that you are all sitting together. Immediately I asked the waiter to see what can be done about this as I couldn't believe no one thought to tell me. The waiter said there was nothing he could do so of course I went straight to the manager. The arrogance and horrible attitude that I encountered was disgusting!!! I asked if they could please try and move tables around or accommodate us as this was a reservation that was held for almost a week. He didn't even try and said no there's nothing he can do. I asked him why I wasn't told this and he said \""we do not have to disclose that.\"" I literally couldn't believe that we were bringing them that much business and they treated me like I was walking in off the streets. \n\nI had to walk away from him as I could feel my blood pressure rising. A family friend went up to him and kept trying to get this worked out and needless to say he wouldn't even apologize. He then stated that he would give us champagne and desserts on the house. He never once came over to the table to apologize or even check on us. They kept saying there was no way to move the tables yet we thought of a TON of ways to get all of us together. \n\nThe dirty looks and rolling of the eyes by the manager and certain staff members was unacceptable to me. The sad thing is that the food was pretty good but because of the horrible service that we received, I would never step foot in this place. Others in the large party said the same thing as they couldn't believe the horrible treatment we received. \n\nI have been to many restaurants around the world and I know what good food and service feels like.

However, I finished off the remains of a teriyaki steak, and loved every bite. The mashed potatoes were tasty, and the gravy was excellent. The salad bar at Feeney's was a pleasant surprise that both I and my family enjoyed. If you're looking for a Greek restaurant, Feeney's is the place to go. My friend and I came in for a late lunch around 2:30pm and we were greeted and seated quickly, since there was nobody here. I ordered the calamari and my friend ordered the iceberg salad. Our food came out surprisingly fast, not in a good way, basically as fast as a fast food restaurant would bring out your order. The iceberg salad was drowned in dressing and the lettuce was limp and lifeless. It tasted like it was premixed and was sitting in the refrigerator overnight, disgusting. The calamari was alright. The last time I came here when the place first opened it was delicious, downgraded quite a bit. Although we got seated quickly and our food came out quickly, after that the waitress barely even came to our table to check up on us. We sat here for an extra hour waiting for our check. Definitely will not be coming back, would rather check out Olive Garden.",2,concat

The guys working the front desk are super nice, but unfortunately the actual work there was absolutely no good.  The only thing they got right was a basic oil change. I have a 2004 Toyota SUV and I took it into Art's for the first time for some work and they replaced the shocks, did the oil change, and supposedly did some work on the brakes.  They charged us just over $1,000 for the work which was reasonable. I have no problem with that. A couple days after getting the car back it started making a really obnoxious squeaking and creaking noise when I braked, turned, went over bumps, or even got out of the car! We called Art's and took the car back.  The mechanic got into the car to listen to the noise while I drove and commented that he is \""not used to working on cars like this\"". I'm not sure what he meant, a Toyota is pretty common and basic! We left it there and it was quiet for about a day after picking it up later.  It started squeaking again, this time it was worse though.  We decided to pay and take it to Toyota AutoNation and they figured out the problem right away.  Art's had given us a defective shock that wasn't supposed to go in my type of car. I'm baffled on how they didn't realize this the second time around at Art's.  We took it back for the third time, told them what AutoNation said and showed them the paperwork, and they replaced the shock.  However, a couple days later the car was worse than ever and I was almost scared to drive it.  We gave up on Art's and went back to AutoNation.  The shock Art's used was STILL the wrong type of shock, and they told us my wheels could have come off while driving.  They also checked the brakes and apparently there was about a millimeter left on the back where Art's had supposedly fixed them.  My car is now just fine thanks to AutoNation's common sense.  I am very disappointed with Art's: It complete wast of time and money on incompetent mechanics and useless car parts.",2,concat

A must-try if you're down on Fremont near Container Park. Whatever you do, AVOID HERTZ AT ALL COST AT THIS AIRPORT.\nSince, 2011, I've probably flown into Phoenix 3 or 4 times.  Each and every time I had a reservation and my name wasn't on the Gold marquee when I arrived.  After waiting in line at the GOLD booth, I then had to WAIT for a car.  This rarely happens in any other city.  And, If this is the way they treat a preferred GOLD member, I can only imagine how other non-status customers are treated.  If this were an isolated incident in Phoenix, I could understand.  But, 3 or 4 times in a row is just simply poor management and incompetentence ... and they are not at all apologetic.  Just last week, I almost missed an hour of the meeting because I was waiting 45 minutes for a car.  Ridiculous.\n\nHere's the best part ... they sent me a survey and I have them horrible rankings.  The lowest score on the \""recommend\"" scale.  Do you think anyone bothered to contact me?  NOPE.  :)   Then, a week later, they had the nerve to send me an e-mail asking if I would like to post my comments on various social media sites.  Now that's some really incompetent target marketing if I've ever seen any.  \n\nEven though this is who I my company negotates rates with and is our preferred rental car providor, I'll have to choose a different providor at this airport.",2,concat

When we got to the register, the girl wanted to make sure we found everything we were looking for, politely we said yes, and the line behind us was growing. When a second girl tried to open the other register, the store manager humiliated her by rudely telling her not to do this and she needed to count stock. And the stock was just tank tops on a table that there were plenty of. It surprised me that she would speak to the staff so harshly, especially when she was trying to get the patrons to make purchases.

Subway who?\n\nPros:\n*  Everything I've tried here is bursting with flavor!  I have yet to discover a bad 'wich.\n*  home made chips.  Jared doesn't have that.  Nor does Quizno's.\n*  a plethora of toppings/additions available (from Pesto to crispy onion strings).\n\nCons:\n*  It's a bit more pricey in comparison to Subway, but well worth the price.  Honest!\n*  seating is a bit limited.  There are outside seats, but it still gets super crowded.\n*  service isn't stellar, but whatever.\n\nOverall:\n  I highly recommend this place for those that love sandwiches.  Really, you've just gotta try it for yourself.  If you have never been... here's a little heads up:  \nChoose your bag and grab a crayon.  Bubble in your choices and viola!  After making your selections and choosing whether you want to make it a combo, watch the sandwich artists clothespin your 'wich bag to a wire and zip-line that baby.  Not making any sense?  Just go in and check it out.  You'll see. \n\nTips:\n*  Pesto is a must.  \n*  Carb-Watching?  You can get any sandwich in a bowl instead.\n*  my personal recommendation is the Surf n Turf.  it's roast beef w/ imitation crab. Probably the most pathetic place I have ever been.

I also had the sauteed greens, which were a bit salty for my taste but still good.  My companion ordered the Chrurrasco beef, which was definitely the best thing we ate there.

He was a practicing magician too which helped a lot. He really knew his stuff! I'm not sure why everyone is posting anything positive for this salon. I had gone here with a schedule appointment for me and 3 other girls. We showed up slightly early and they had taken 2 girls before us that were getting their pedicures finished. We didn't think anything of it because they said they were almost done. Mind you, we told them when scheduling the appointment that we were on a time crunch so we would book if they could guarantee that there would be 4 technicians so we could all get our pedis/manis done at the same time. They had said it would not be a problem. We waited for about 30 minutes until the owner came over and said we could get started soaking at the mani station for one girl. The technicians then informed her that we couldn't because the 2 girls they had taken before us were getting manis now too. So, then my girl had to sit in a random chair soaking her nails for no reason. Then they set me and another girl up in the pedi station. We sat with our feet in the water only to look down and realize that the bubbles in the water had dead skin floating in it. Absolutely unsanitary and disgusting. Most nail salons I go to put a disposable plastic tub inside of the tub so there is no issue of this.

If I could give this bar no stars or half of one star, I would.  \n\nMy husband and I played video poker here for less than two hours on a Saturday afternoon (around 2:00 pm, when the bar was not busy), and we had THE WORST service we have ever experienced in Vegas from the bartender, Josh.  He was rude, offensive and extremely condescending.  When we sat down we both put $100 into the machines, and began playing the max bet, which was a requirement we both fully understood and were fine with to be able to comp our drinks.  Josh reminded us when he brought the first round that we could have one drink every 30 minutes, and that we needed to be playing the max bet.  Again, we were fine with that and it was not an issue.\n\nWe started playing and were winning.  After about 35 minutes or so we ordered our second round of drinks and Josh, who was busy making shots and espresso martinis for the two couples next to us (of whom only one person was playing the video poker machine occasionally but all four persons were receiving comped drinks), seemed annoyed.  He reluctantly brought us the drinks and then continued to ignore us and boast an air of arrogance to all of those around him.\n\nFinally, after another 35-40 minutes had gone by, we asked Josh for a final round of drinks, and he rudely told us that he had to ask his floor manager because he didn't know if we had played enough.  His comment was absurd and delivered in such a way that we could not have been more offended.  He did not adhere to this policy with any of the other players around us, so why we were singled out when we had been consistently gambling and did not ask for drinks before we knew 30+ minutes had passed just baffled us.  We were merely killing time before taking a limo to the airport, so his behavior was just absurd.\n\nAfter checking with his floor manager who informed him that we had been gambling enough and another drink was approved, he decided to tell us that before he could give us another drink we had been warned by him, and that \""his job was on the line.\""  We were LIVID.  My husband offered to pay for the drinks, and we left right away to speak with management about the treatment we had just received.  Upon asking to speak to the manager we were told to walk back to the Bar and that he/she would be there to talk to; however, no one was to be found.  We don't know if it was by the hand of Josh that this person never appeared, but it leaves us to conclude that this particular bar and this particular bartender are some of the worst in not just Vegas, but the US.  \n\nWe are huge fans of the Aria and were extremely disappointed in this service experience and the way it was handled afterwards.

I am a regular customer at this boutique and always prefer to shop local when it is at all possible. What she is right about is yes the selection is awesome and the prices are the same in the big box stores too. What I don't understand is what she claims her experience with Emily was. I have shopped with her on many occasion and have seen her interact with other guest while assisting me. I can't imagine her \""god awful customer service\"" was unprovoked! I can see in the review by JG the offensive language she uses that she probably isn't the most tactful person, even she comments she was probably out of line.

Also, she says she will tell all of her friends that they should never shop there, well she is doing them a great dis-service. The women at this store at times saved me from becoming very frustrated after my child was born and had a hard time nursing.

Once I walked up to her and asked if the table we order could be pulled so that we could pick up her response was if you scheduled it to picked up it will be ready.

It may be because I am really picky about my sushi, being that I am Japanese. The tempura rolls we ordered was not what I was used to. Sin City fries the whole roll in breading, I like mine with the tempura on the INSIDE of the roll. The raw fish in any of my rolls didn't seem fresh. I noticed a fishy smell when I walked into the restaurant. That may have been a clue.  The service was VERY SLOW.  Maybe it's different during dinner but I will never return.",2,concat

They take your typical American burger and kick it up a notch with great asian flavor. On top of that, they always have great service! Expensive drinks? No big deal. Almost 100% hipster crowd? Fine. The problem here is the way the management treats its customers. We sat at a table upstairs at 9:00 PM. At 11:20 we were asked to move to another table.

I tried to call before going and much to my disappointment YELP CONTAINS THE wrong number. The correct number is 702-434-9333 Went here as a choice of the in-laws. Hadn't been to a Macaroni Grill in a few years, and was actually looking forward to it as my past experiences (although never at this location) were very good. When we were seated they tried to put us in the first table just outside of the main path back to the kitchen, even though the place was practically empty (it was a Tues evening). When we asked to move out of the main traffic area, they offered a table one spot away from the original one. OK, we'll play your silly game, let's not address the 800 lb gorilla in the room (the 85% empty restaurant). Once seated our server stopped by very quickly to get drink orders and apps.  Before the app came out, our server was back to take our dinner order (so far, so good, right? Ahhhh, just wait). We ordered: Lasagna w/side salad, Capellini with meat sauce, Eggplant Parmesan  with a side of sausage, and a Parmesan Crusted Chicken Salad.  The side salad came out not long after the app, and then the wait began. Not sure how long, but it was long enough for the entire table to get antsy and for us to ask for more bread. We even joked that it was because someone ordered lasagna.  When the main courses came out, take a guess which one didn't come out with them...you ready? The Parmesan Crusted Chicken Salad. Seriously. The rest of the table started eating (it can't be that far behind, right?) and no kidding, they were at least halfway through their main course when they brought out a salad with what looked like a half of a chicken tender chopped up in it. I thought maybe they had tossed it in or something, and when I confirmed the few small pieces were all that was there, it went from not so good to bad (and soon to really bad...wait for it...).\n\nSo, here I sat with this sad salad with a couple pieces of chicken, and because the wait had been so long, I was done. I told the server I didn't want it anymore and to send it back. Then I told her to make sure her manager saw what was coming out of the kitchen. I saw her talk to the manager and she came back and said they were going to make some more chicken. I told her that I didn't want it at all. I saw her go talk to the manager, who was at this point standing in front of the girl making salads) and I know by her body language and his that she told him I didn't want it at all. A few minutes later I saw them put more chicken on the salad, put some more dressing on it, and he started walking over. When he got to the table I was PISSED (yeah, really). I asked him what part of \""I don't want it\"" did he not understand and he just stood there hovering over me with this damn salad in his hands. I explained everything that had happened and he told me that the server never told him that I didn't want it at all. He asked if there was anything he could do and I said \""Yes, you can go away\"" (he was still just standing there staring at me like he could use the Force to make me take the salad.\n\nNow, you might be thinking, \""Damn, little harsh Bro!\"" Ah yeah, but wait til you hear what sent me over the top...\n\nWhen our server came back (who was very nice and apologetic this entire time) I asked her if she told him that I didn't want the salad at all, no matter how much chicken they put on it, she said (and I fully believe her) \""Yes, I told him that\"". So I told her how he lied to me and threw her under the bus. THAT is just inexcusable. Forget to put an order in, fine. Something not cooked right, oopps.  Throw one of your workers under the bus? Piss poor.\n\nOh yeah, and the app we ordered was zucchini hold the cheese, and it came with cheese, and the side of sausage never came out.\n\nWould I ever go there again? Not a chance. At this point I don't know when I'll even risk going to another Macaroni Grill.",2,concat

I find myself here on random Sundays and the ladies working here are great they have definitely been here for a long time and know everything on the menu!! The food is always great - i seriously always get a burger but we start with the wings with the sauce on the side and they are really good nice and crispy!!  The BF gets the Fried Oysters Appetizer its a HUGE portion and plenty on there that he cant even finish himself!! The only thing I would say negative was we went when it was 100 out and it was pretty warm in there but they cant help it with an open kitchen. Its a great place in a great area! Horrible service!!! Family and I decided to eat Mexican food and chose this establishment to have dinner at.  We wanted to see what was their dinner special and they frowned upon that right away.  They brought us warm tap water and semi cold beer. When they brought us our food they just set it on the table and left without saying if there is anything else we need which we did. They never checked up on us to see if we needed another drink. The food seemed like it was canned food. I specifically asked for no onions and it seems like I said add all the onions u have in the back. No one person that I went with enjoyed the experience let alone the food. This is one establishment we will never go to again!!!,2,concat

The additional musicians were amazing too...and added such a uniqueness to the event.  All the songs were terrific, we had so much fun dancing and Jared himself MC'd and he was fantastic.  What a great affair, I would definitely hire him for my next big event! Well, this is a first for me, in writing a review where the experience was so poor on entry to engaging the restaurant that I can't even comment on the food.\n\nTonight is our 10 year anniversary, so I thought it fitting that we go to an iconic location while in Las Vegas, The Bellagio.\n\nPrime is their center field front row top steak restaurant, or so they market themselves.\n\nThe idea is a traditional steakhouse in an ideal setting with indoor and outdoor dining while viewing the majestic Bellagio fountains.\n\nI took the time to call this afternoon and secure a late reservation (9:30pm) indicating clearly the importance of the date and asking for a special location.\n\nWhen we arrived, after walking through the Bellagio AKA Grand Central Station meets Disneyland's crowd, we approached the hostess stand.\n\nNow a restaurant selling itself as a top notch experience should have a direct human interaction upon entry, not two teenage girls working behind a desk.\n\nWorse, what clearly must have been the assistant manager walked past us, ignoring us on the way to take a phone call that was obviously more important than acknowledging their guests.\n\nWhile we stood there dressed in suit and my wife's beautiful gown, we endured the conversation that consumed the attention of both \""hostess\"" explaining to the fat man in shorts and an untucked polo shirt, that he was welcome to come in later but needed to wear pants.\n\nNow at this point I have to laugh at the irony. Clearly Prime's reputation is strong enough from a perception standpoint to bring clients in, and the stuffy 'dress code' is there to enhance the \""exclusivity\"" if you will. All the while the service is worse than the worst McDonalds restaurant. What a joke.\n\nWe finally connected with one of the hourly employees at the front counter and they proceeded to try to negotiate with me about wether we had actually requested an outside table or not. It was the equivalent of a conversation with a night club promoter about what it would take to get he table you want. Happy Anniversary I guess... \n\nThe good news is we went to the bar where a very friendly, competent and quality old school bartender provided real service. We ordered a glass of champagne, settled the check and informed person number 6 that I had to interact with that we would be going elsewhere.\n\nThey quickly back peddled, all of a sudden a front row table outside was available.\n\nI politely informed them that we would be going elsewhere.\n\nThe four employees were huddling around with the real manager and watching to see what we would do. I doubt they expected that I would take the time to share the truth about the experience on line.\n\nLook, here is the bottom line. When you are heading out to an expensive dinner, especially for an important event, and preparing to spend a considerable amount of money, you deserve the absolute best service and mentality. There's no entitlement here. Just because your restaurant is overlooking the Bellagio fountains doesn't mean it's automatically any better than a revolving restaurant exploiting its view to sell you overpriced food.\n\nThe restaurant is down stairs from the Bellagio Esplanade, it's a stuffy, dark, cave like environment with a very heavy small of cooked and worked over food. Think senior retirement center cafe with expensive decor.\n\nIf you want my advice, there are a dozen steak houses in town, all much better in every way. I would recommend the SW at Wynn or Carnevino at Pallazo. Of course I can't speak to the food since I couldn't stand the mentality. I can only tell you about the smell and the attitude. Both stink.\n\nTry the bar I guess then high tail it out of there before they take your cash and feed the snob beast.\n\nBetter luck elsewhere.",2,concat

I have always stayed at one of the hotels on the main part of the Strip, so at first I was a little wary of staying on the edge at Trump. I am SO glad that we did, though. Because Trump doesn't have a casino and is nonsmoking, the experience was just way more relaxed - and we were still able to go to other hotels for restaurants and clubs! The staff at Trump is excellent and everyone we interacted with was super professional, courteous and just plain friendly. The rooms are large and clean, and I absolutely adore the deep tubs in the bathrooms. We spent Saturday by the pool and reserved a cabana, something I highly recommend doing. The pool is low key but the music is great, and Sebastian (the person helping us) was the best! My only complaint is that the cabanas are poorly designed - the AC is positioned in such a way that it actually sends cold air OUT of the cabana instead of into it...weird. We also ate a lot of food at Trump, both in the restaurant area downstairs and through room service. Room service was AMAZING (get the onion rings!) - I highly recommend ordering in after a long night, they serve 24 hrs. The breakfast downstairs was stellar too - I loved the crab cake eggs benny.

The caulking all had to be redone and a section was missed completely. There was epoxy left all over the tops and sink, that I had to clean off. The installation crew has no process for covering up anything and really did not care at all. The granite fabricators do not deserve this score however, their work was fine.\nThis company does not care about you as a consumer, read their other reviews, I only review excellent or awful experiences. This was an awful experience.

My favorite server is Kristy. I was in the mood for Fish and Chips, and I'd been thinking about trying this place since it was so close to my apartment. Big mistake. I ordered the Admiral's combo which includes 3 of your seafood choice, fries, and hush puppies. I had the Cod, the shrimp, and the clams. As soon as I get home I dig in, the first piece I had was a clam strip, and it was NASTY; Mushy, undercooked, and extremely fishy tasting. I move on to the shrimp, which was possibly the best cooked out of everything, and the taste was just ok. Finally, the cod, again, slightly undercooked, still gray in color, not flaky, and the batter completely peeled off as soon as I touched it. The fries were, once again, under cooked and soggy. The hush puppies were tasty, but tiny. Worst part about the whole thing is that after an hour of consuming this meal I started getting cold sweats, stomach aches, and a headache. I hadn't had anything else before or after the lunch, so there's no doubt in my mind that the fish (or the poor preparation of it) from this place caused it.

I had cut into my steak to check it before going back and when it came back, it was completely dried out.  The shrimp on my date's filet was absolutely rotten.

Noodles is one of my favorite eats at the Bellagio (as well as the entire strip). \n\nThe restaurant itself is very clean and nicely decorated; staff are friendly and food usually comes out pretty fast. Reasonably priced for hotel restaurant standards. Most dishes are about $18+, with decent sized portions.\n\nMost of their appetizers are nothing to write home about with the exception of the Roti Prata (Roti bread with curry sauce), the curry has just the right amount of kick without being too sweet. The Laksa curry noodle is my favorite dish hands down (huge portion too). Perfectly cooked noodles in a rich coconut curry broth. It's a little spicy so I don't recommend this for people who like their food mild. Another recommendation is the sea bass congee. Mildly seasoned and the fish is very fresh, great choice for someone who is looking for something tasty and light. Their BBQ is surprisingly good and authentic, duck and bbq pork are the two popular choices. Though it can be a little too salty at times. Be sure to try their Mango pudding as well as fresh mango served with a side of coconut sesame rice (forgot the actual name of the dish) if you're craving for something sweet. \n\nNice restaurant, friendly service and great food. There's really nothing to not like about Noodles. Only downside is they tend to get pretty busy, if you go during dinner time there's usually a wait. I wish I could give this store no stars. Stopped in during a girls trip in December of last year to buy my boyfriend a Christmas gift. It was during the day and I was dressed in comfortable clothes (jeans, t-shirt, and Chuck's). The staff didn't say one word to me nor did they even acknowledge my presence in the store, which was obscenely overpriced for the quality. A gentlemen walked in wearing designer clothes and the staff was more than happy to greet and assist him. Apparently, I didn't look like a serious buyer so the staff didn't give me the time of day. I work very hard and can afford to shop at a store like John Varvatos but after my experience in Las Vegas I won't ever step foot into one of his judge mental stores again.",2,concat

We were transferred several times, each time the person on the other end of the phone knew less and less. The only thing we did find out was you can not change or cancel any of the add-ons over the phone.

Here is my story:\n\nI was completely freaked out after my primary care physician confirmed she felt the same lump in my breast that I did.  My Dr. told me to call an unnamed breast imaging place that my insurance would cover.  They couldn't get me into their place until a month later even though it was to be a diagnostic mammo and ultrasound in response to finding what I thought was a lump.  My husband said we couldn't wait and he called around and found that Breastnet could see us on Monday (this was on the Friday before the Monday).  We were thrilled!  I was too anxious to make it very long.  I was obsessing.\n\nBreastnet was FABULOUS!!!  They responded to how freaked out I was and were very supportive.  The technician was very sweet and helped calm me.  The Dr. was so good with me.  She told me as she did the ultrasound that it all looked good.  I was so relieved.  I squeezed her hand in joy and she was very friendly.  I highly recommend going here if you need to get your mammo and/or ultrasound as soon as you can.  Also, the atmosphere is very calming in general.  Thank you, Breastnet! This is easily the worst hotel I've ever stayed in. It really seems like it should be illegal to charge how much they charge for a place in such a state of disrepair, and not even that conveniently located.  I don't think I'm particularly picky with hotels; I just want clean, safe, and quiet. But \""Quality\"" suites seemed like more of a sketchy place you'd rent by the hour to conduct a drug deal or perform other illicit activity and then leave, not to actually sleep in. \n\nThe condition of the room was absolutely awful. It smelled horribly like rotting garbage, and despite emptying the majority of a bottle of Febreze it still smelled terrible. Nearly everything in the room looked like it had been brought in during the 70's, and then left for the next 40 years. Again, I was shocked that they could charge this much for how poorly maintained it was.\n\nUpon check-in we were excited to discover the complimentary shuttle. I was thinking that this might be the saving grace of the hotel and justify both the cost and the stench. We booked 2 spots on the shuttle to take us to Heinz field the next morning and were told to go to a specified pickup place to get the shuttle back and that they would be running pickups every 30 minutes up to 3 hours after the game. If there was no shuttle, then we were told to just call and ask to be picked up. Ok, sounds great. We go to our game, walk around the city a bit, and then only 2 hours after the game went to the designated pickup spot. We waited for a few minutes and I decided to call, just to check on the status of the shuttle. We're told the driver was just leaving and that he would be there in 20 minutes. 45 minutes later, still no shuttle. I decided to call and check in again. I'm now told that the shuttle has a load of people to take to the Penguins game and that he can get me in an hour. Unacceptable. This could've been their saving grace, but ended up being just as bad.\n\nI will never ever stay here again and highly recommend looking elsewhere for your lodging needs anywhere around Pittsburgh. There is not one redeeming quality about this scam of a place.",2,concat

Due to working out and keeping in shape I eat at Teriyaki Madness, Greens and Proteins and my favorite Genghis Grill. I come here 4 days a week and have never had any problems. Great A+service, I'm always welcomed once I come in, staff is always helpful and the General Manager Reagan is one of the nicest people you will ever meet. She goes above and beyond to make sure you have an enjoyable experience each time you visit. Its hard to find good healthy food on the go because this country has fast food places at every corner and the pricest are cheap. Normally trying to eat healthy cost you a lot of money. So instead of going to a fast food place and getting a fatting meal and a soda for $6-$7.00 why not come here a get a healthy meal and an unsweetned ice tea for a few dollars more. Where else in the valley can you go where you can put as much meat on your bowl as you can with no weight limit? I can get enough meat on one regular size bowl (there is a strategy to it) and I can get two feeling meals out of it.  There are plenty of meats to choose from, a lot of seasonings, vegetables are always fresh, plenty of sauces to choose from and at the end you can choose your starch.  It takes me about 4 minutes to complete my bowl and 15 minutes for them to cook it before I'm on my way to work. Teriyaki Madness is good but you can get burned out on it because its cooked the same way.  Teriyaki Madness used to be generous with their meet but as they expanded and are known there starting to get stingy. With Genghis Grill you control how your bowl is. If your on a low sodium diet you control the amount of seasoning you can put in it. If your tired of a sauce, there are plenty of others to try from so I never get burned out from eating there. I already have 10 free bowls. 80% of being fit is what your eating. You can work out all day but if your diet is wrong you wont see results. Life is fast paced nowadays and if you got kids at practice and your wife or husband works as well as you its hard to cook everyday. This is a great option if you live life on the go like me. I would not even give one star but i did receive one good hair cut. Been here 3 times 1st time was a good hair cut by Curtis but the atmosphere is ghetto play loud music to the point you have to scream at each other. The next time got another hair cut from Curtis this time guys walking in with pit bulls guys yelling at each other again because music is to loud. The hair cut wasn't as good he was distracted by all the stuff going on. The 3rd time went in asked for hair cut since Curtis was off they referred me to Bobby waited 2:30 hours for 3 guys to get haircut since the other 2 barbers decided to stop cutting hair for the day at 3pm. I waited patiently till my turn was up next which now is almost 5:30 pm a guy walks in off the street ask for a touch up. Which Bobby must have known and tells me I have to wait while he touches up his hair so he can go out later. I walked out and the other person who was behind me also walked out. The customer service sucks the atmosphere is a run down hole in the wall. The walls are white which look Grey I know they are white from a poster removed that is the only white spot on the wall. Ceiling fan, broke holes in the wall. The bathroom is a shit hole never been cleaned you are better off holding it. The prices say $14 for haircut but when I asked how much I owed he told me $20. I got a good hair cut once so try to give benefit of doubt and went back but will never be back with the last bull shit they pulled.",2,concat

Brian the head waiter is awesome and a pleasure to see . The beer is always ice cold and the shakes are delicious!\n\n$5 burger mondays are insane! We came to Aliante casino to enjoy their new restaurant Cabo. I received a email to come and try the $7.99 All U Can Eat Taco special that is available all-day. The wait time to be seated is about 20 min but that is expected because the restaurant is brand new to the Aliante community. Sitting at the bar is quicker and the bartender is pretty cool. \n\nBut this entire experience turned into something very horrible. Once we were seated and placed our order for two tacos each, it took Cabo exactly one hour to bring the first order of tacos out to us. Prior to receiving our food, we had to complain to the manager that its taking forever and he advised us that our food is now ready to be delivered to our table. Moments later one of our many waitress' advised us that our order has been lost and they have to start over on making our food. This really had me beyond upset. Once again we complained to the manager and he offered to comp our drinks from the bar and food.\n\nNow, once our food finally came out after many complaints and waitinf for 60 minutes to get it and eating through two baskets of chips, we all thought everything was going to be smooth sailing from there until the one person in my party, who's allergic to tomatoes and onions, began to feel really really sick while eating. She distinctly told the manager and a waiter and waitress that she's allergic to those ingredients three times before ordering. They didn't put the ingredients on her tacos but failed to tell her that they marinated their meats in a tomatoe and onion sauce.\n\nAfter she ran out the restaurant to puke all of her food up the manager kept asking me if I would like another drink and I'm like \""No! You jerk! You guys just poisoned my friend!\"". Cabo eventually called security who then called the EMT's who had to treat her. It was so embarrassing. After being treated and filing an incident report with Aliante Casino's Risk Management department we went back to Cabo to get a business card and info of the manager. His name was Joe, he refused to give us his last name, and gave us a business card of Cabo's food and beverage director who's not even located in Las Vegas. How unprofessional is that?!\n\nOn the other hand, Pricing on food ranges from $4-$18 depending on what you order. They also have a 3p-6:30p on Fridays and that includes $4-$6 and a drink special that include beverages from $4-$6.\n\nOverall, the new addition to Aliante casino is horrid! I will never again in my life order food or even a glass of water from this horrible restaurant. We even told the manager that we're affiliates of Yelp.com and he gave us a serious blank stare and asked \""What is Yelp?\"". Really sir?! Smh at this unorganized establishment and its rude staff. The only reason I give this restaurant one Yelp Star rating is because its not available to give them a negative five Yelp Star.",2,concat

First, the atmosphere is great...it's mellow with some kpop playing in the background.  And the drinks are fantastic as well...my favorite, by far, was the yogurt soju cocktails.  They're sweet and super light, but you'll definitely feel the effects fast.  Order the pitcher, it's a great deal.\n\nBut the food is the real star.  We started off with seafood dduk boki (spicy seafood with korean ricecake tubes) and it was super fresh and delicious.  Also, the owners were kind enough to send us over a pot of free odeng (fishcakes in a bubbling hot broth) and it was sooo good, especially dipped in the special soy sauced based sauce.  We also ordered the korean chicken wings (sticky, spicy, amazing), the kimchi fried rice (the best I've ever had, next to mom's), the spicy bbq pork (really smokey and a little spicy...super good), the cold noodles, and the bi bim bap.  Everything was incredible and we left stuffed.  Also, the prices are very reasonable, the service was excellent, and did I mention how good the food is??\n\nCheck it out, asap!

The only one that tops it is Caesar's Palace and their Roman Baths. This one comes second and the spa at Bellagio comes third. They have a small cold plunge, a middle sized warm spa, and a larger hot spa. I think the warm and the hot should switch but honestly their warm water spa felt amazing. It was so relaxing and felt amazing. I soaked in it for a long time after my massage. they also have a steam room and sauna. The relaxation areas were great too. They have a very comfortable quiet room which I fell asleep in. I also fell asleep on on of the lounge chairs where the spas are. The ladies working there were awesome. They served fruit, hot and cold teas, water, coffee, and a yummy juice blend that I loved! The also have showers with shampoo, conditioner and body wash for afterwards. they also have a vanity area complete with brushes, hairdryers, curling irons, mouthwash, and everything you need to fix yourself up before you leave. \n\nThe Massage:\nThey asked me on the phone when I booked the appointment and asked me if  preferred I male or female therapist. I said I had no preference because I really don't. As long as they do a good job I could care less. they set me up with a male therapist named Gio. He did an amazing job on my massage, he asked me if there were any areas I cared to focus on and areas to avoid. He listened to me well and did as I asked, I don't know why but it seems like male therapists tend to understand the amount pressure I like and do a better job achieving that. Females tend to go a little too hard to the point of where it hurts while male therapists seem to understand their own strength and be little more gentle. That is just my personal experience though. Now onto the massage. He did an amazing job and focused on my lower back and shoulders which are my problem areas. The entire massage felt amazing from start to finish however. i was very pleased. I highly recommend Gio. \n\nOverall, i loved this spa and I most definitely will be back and I will ask for Gio when I call. It is a very relaxing place to spend the day in. They keep it very clean and the customer service is great. I'm not all that picky when it comes to Chinese food. My wife often says I have no clue so I'll have to say I can tolerate even mediocre Chinese food and think it's not too bad. But this place? It was bad. REAL bad. I guess in Chinese it's called Number One BBQ and in English it's BBQ King -- kinda similar don't you agree? The food was anything but that. It was no King, no Queen, no Ace. It was a Joker! That's what it was. Honestly, bbq pork is better in Irvine and even Irvine is not good for Chinese food.\n\nMaybe that's why there weren't many people in this place when we ate here?

TAO staff is constantly pushing through the crowd to get bottles/mixers to a certain table and I know its frustrating, but pretending your a running-back and mobbing through the crowd won't solve anything.\n\n\nTAO BEACH is upstairs, but you have to climb a staircase from section to section which is a buzz kill and is a drag when you're trying to get the mack on. upstairs is the pool area/lounge which is perfect after getting your swerve on downstairs. climate controlled heaters, plush sofas, another bar, a DJ, and security all packed into one. perfect place to gather yourself, return missed calls, texts, and bbms, or check the facebook hahaha.

Since the company was offering to pay the admission fee, I accepted the challenge.  \n\nI had planned only to walk all the way, since I had developed plantar fasciitis on my left foot from all those years of running ten miles everyday.  However, it being my first marathon event and with so many eager attendees, I began the event with a running start.  Funnily enough, I was running/walking four to six miles every other day up until about sept. or oct. 2007.  From then on, I was only doing cardio, strength, and flexibility DVD exercises, so I really did not train for this event; Yet, I am proud to have finished the run/walk, and with a good time (2:28), as well!\n\nI'd like to thank a few nameless (and faceless)  people, young and elderly, who I kept pace with.  It was so inspiring to see so many in their 60s and beyond keeping pace (and humbling, too, to have many more pass me by!).  Many thanks to the cheering people, squads and individuals alike, who showed up with their smiles and high spirits, and also I tip my hat to the volunteers who handed out nourishments along the way!\n\nI skipped on pre-registering for next year thinking that my employer would do the event again, and this time doing it right by having a tent set up for the aftermath celebration, but alas, my employer elected not to sponsor a second time on account of so many no-show employees which cost the company so much money.  Tsk, tsk.  Perhaps those of us who wanted to run next year's event will be able to talk our employer into supporting us in 2010!  If you're thinking of signing up, think no more and just do it!  It'll be an event you'll remember for the rest of your life. I gave the airport one star not because it's ugly or that it's difficult to catch a cab or get your luggage.  I gave it one star because the TSA agent was SO incredibly arrogant and nasty to all the passengers trying to get through the security checkpoint.  \n\nWhile I understand it must be difficult maintaining order while thousands of people get through security everyday, I do NOT think it's necessary to be an A$$HOLE to everyone and go on with your diatribe (repeated every time he's done) VERY loudly and very demeaning (I'm sure this isn't in the employee handbook because I've been through MANY airports and I've never encountered this before...EVER).  Publicly shaming passengers for missteps (again...VERY loud and trying to embarrass passengers).  One person (not me) left their shoes on the belt and didn't push them in and he CALLED THEM OUT on it and then harrassed them in front of several hundred people.  Seriously?  No one should be allowed to behave that way.  \n\nI WANTED to say something to the guy but you know that they would have pulled me out of line and made me miss my flight.  \n\nI really hope that someone reads this and notifies his supervisor and he gets FIRED.  This is one of those situations that someone gets a bit of authority over others and takes it to the extreme.  I'm pretty disgusted with the morning and I really hope that Karma bites this guy in the rear because after what I witnessed this morning around 830 am, he has it coming to him.",2,concat

This was easily one of the top three meals I have ever eaten. And the service was fantastic to boot. \n\nWaygu beef is their specialty, so why would you not get the Waygu beef?  It's not cheap but c'mon, this is Vegas, my guess is you've already wasted as much on slots/poker/craps/roulette/etc. If you're not a local, when in Vegas, live it up! \n\nWe decided to get the three course meal, and it was an obscene amount of food. Between two of you, you get three half salads, lobster bisque, two types of Waygu beef, three sides and four deserts. Redic, but oh so delicious. When you look at the cost of that, compared to the cost of the filet, just go with the three course meal, you can't go wrong. Nothing disappointed - and even though I could only eat one bite of the monkey bread, man that was one delicious bite. \n\nSure, you can find a less expensive place to eat, but you won't find a more delicious steak.

Shepherd's pie was too hot (definitely microwaved) and kind of bland although the meat was like chef boyardee.  Also, the decor was bad, everything they had hung was wrinkled.

Me and my girlfriend had an absolute blast.\nSpecial note*** Aurora at the front desk took great care of us.  She even surprised us by buying a bottle of red wine for my girlfriend on her birthday!  Who does that?!  High recommendations. My first review ever. \n\nThe short version: Rejected dive hotel buffet scraps recycled at a Hash House A GO GO.\n\nThere were 6 of us in town for my bachelor party weekend. As a fan of San Diego's Hash House I happened to convince my party to check out HH LV at the Imperial House. The service was the absolute worst with the consensus on the food being mediocre (mediocre only because some had nothing to compare Imperial Palace Hash House to). It was so bad that I need to write a review.\n\nHere's how it went:\n\nFist, ever sit for breakfast after a night of hardcore binging only to yell your order to the server? The loud music became very apparent when the waitress felt compelled to ask, \""huh,\"" \""what was that,\"" \""can you repeat that,\"" for just about all six of us at the table. This was a problem for the hung over amongst us. \n\nNext, a friend whom doesn't eat meat asked for a substitution for the ham, sausage and/or bacon options. She politely says to him, \""No, I'm sorry. We don't really substitute here. Usually people will order their food and just not eat the meat.\"" The friend of mine follows with, \""soooo, no fruit... nothing?\"" \""No,\"" she replies, \""sorry.\"" \n\nThis was a bummer for a person who's never experienced the real deal Hash House. Sadly, it continues downhill.\n\nWe order our food. I got the Basic Breakfast which included eggs (I asked for over-medium) with bacon, potatoes and a side of biscuits and gravy (layoffa me I was starving!!). A couple people ordered the chicken (dry) and waffles while others had omelets and various other items. Two of us receive partial meals while others had complete orders delivered. At this point in time, the ice water's are dry while our server is MIA (she was overly chatty with the two/three tables she serviced). I received my side of biscuits and gravy and continued to wait for the rest of my food. Two others at the table sat without any food or water. Then the rest of my food comes. Low and behold, the eggs were undercooked (perhaps she would have heard me say over-medium had the music not been so loud?). The clear slime made the eggs inedible. The bacon was tiny, shriveled and cold (SD HH is huge, thick-cut deliciousness). The potatoes were not Hash House rosemary style potatoes. Rather, they were dive-bar buffet status potatoes that sat under a heat lamp for hours and far too hot to eat. Then, I discovered the clear like gelatin chunks in the only thing I thought to be edible, the biscuits & gravy. This was utterly disgusting. Meanwhile, as most of us are more than half-way through our breakfasts, we realize two of us at the table had yet to receive their meals.\n\nFinally, our server breaks away from her story telling at other tables to check on us. I informed of the two missing meals. She runs in to check in the kitchen and comes back with our order slip and asks us what we're missing. She falls back to the kitchen; comes back to apologize, and carries on to her other tables. In the end, we get our meals while I borderline on losing my cookies all over the table. The server only deducted my meal from the bill and we happily leave the joint.\n\nThanks for reading.",2,concat

I saw another group being told the same thing, unless you specifically paid for your table, guys were not allowed, which made no sense.\n\n30 min before Calvin Harris came on, another security guy and another man with a clipboard came up to our table flashing flash lights and demanding we leave - we were not allowed to sit at the table and had to move - they were yelling at us continuously telling us to move with absolutely no explanation as to why. After arguing with the man and demanding he at least tell us why we had to go - he told us an owners friend had bought out the table and he had to give it them 'or else he's lose his f******* job\"" as though it was out fault. \n\nI know that this is not unusual in clubs, to be asked to leave a free table (given by promoters) when someone who can afford to buy it comes along- but the workers their were SO RUDE about it, as though we had snuck into the table and stole their alcohol.\n\nAfter leaving the table we went down into the crowd which was so crowded my friends and I were literally stuck in the same position for 10 min, absolutely unable to move, at the same time the bottle service attendants are shoving you from behind - I remember asking one of them, who was carrrying a large stack of cups to a table to \""not push me\"" to which he responded he'll \""push me if he has to\"" and then did. \n\nAnother friend was repeatedly yelled at and threatened to be kicked out because she was leaning against a surface close and kinda connected to the tables - her back was turned to the Dj and crowd and it was clear she just needed somewhere to sit for bit\n\nIn addition, water bottles (8oz fuji waters) were $8 dollars each, a redbull was $9 - As they made us get their 4 hours early because we \""had a table\"" we all sobered up pretty fast - which meant you had to spend I cant imagine how much on drink from the bar.. which costs a lot!\n\nOverall, I would never go back here -  The club itself was definitely cool, but the workers there all seem to be on power highs from working in the \""hottest\"" club in vegas, its just not worth it - I have been to Las Vegas multiple times and to a lot of different clubs but have never experienced such arrogant and pretentious servers and security. - they literally ruined our night\n\nI would recommend Surrender, XS, or any of other clubs!

I can go for 6 months without being able to visit Baguette, and Olivier still welcomes me like family and asks how I've been as casually as if I'd been seeing him every week. \n\nI see a lot of people complaining about how to find the place. \n\nHERE IS A TIP FOR THE EASIEST WAY TO GET TO BAGUETTE. \n\nIf you are driving westbound on the 215, take the Buffalo exit. Go straight through the light at the top of the hill. You will be on a street parallel to the freeway, and you will drive right up next to the business park on your right before you hit Durango. There will be 3 total turns off of that side road (also known as Raphael Rivera Way). Take either the 2nd or the 3rd and you will be at Baguette. It is right in between those two entrances, up against Raphael Rivera. It truly doesn't get any easier than that. See? Not so hard?\n\nIf you truly have no choice but to drive through the business park (say, if you were coming east/southbound on the 215),  when you turn off of Sunset do NOT just drive all willy nilly through the middle of the business park. That's how you are all getting so frustrated and hitting dead ends. Look at a Google map. If you refuse to look at a map ahead of time, then stick to the west side of the business park. Take Ganger Rd when you turn off Sunset, and stick closely to that far west side of the business park as you wind your way to the back of the business park towards Raphael Rivera. Eventually you will see that row of buildings that Baguette is tucked into in the very back peeking through the larger business structures.\n\nBut seriously. Just look at a map. It's worth it.\n\n*After going today, I noticed that they've expanded their outdoor seating. TONS of places to sit now with plenty of umbrellas, it's very exciting for their lunchtime rush to see some extra room! Where do I start?  If you know anything about music and what a DJ should actually sound like, stay far far away.\n\nI went here to see Craze and never thought I could be so disappointed.  The opening DJ was painful to listen to.  Even with a serato, he couldn't beat match to save his life.  He also couldn't get his levels right, come up with a decent track selection, or scratch (um, you're opening for Craze... stop embarrassing yourself).  The crowd still ate it up.  I'm not normally very judgmental, but this crowd was the lowest of the low and not what you would expect in a Vegas club.  The go-go dancers were ok with the exception of one - she had no clue what she was doing.  The dancers are supposed to set the tone for the crowd, so I guess she fit in perfectly.  When Craze went on, he totally played for this crappy crowd.  I had to book it out of there.  It was a very disheartening experience.\n\nI wish I could give this place zero stars.

Three hearts of romaine were rapped with Serrano ham, the tastiest white anchovies I have ever had, and then dressed with a homemade Caesar dressing and croutons. This was hands-down the best Caesar I have had. While we were eating out salad, the drunk guy at the table next to us advised us to order these \""hatch chili peppers\"", which are apparently a rare pepper only found in New Mexico and have the tendency to only be good two months out of the year. I am glad we listened to him because these grilled hatch peppers were amazing. They had a delicate flavor with a thin crisp skin. Some of the bites were spicier than others but the taste was similar to an Anaheim pepper mixed with a Serrano - fantastic. I ordered the 20 oz. New York strip steak and my friends ordered the Porterhouse and Hanger steak. All the steaks were prime cuts of Omaha beef, perfectly seasoned with coarse salt and pepper and then scorched under the broiler. Each steak had a nice crust and some grill marks, but wasn't over powered with char or that grilled taste. My NY strip was sheer perfection. The two-inch thick hunk of meat was melt-in-your-mouth tender, and just had the most amazing after taste.\n\nWe also ordered the saut\u00e9ed spinach and Yukon gold puree for sides. The mash potatoes were very good but lacked a bit of salt. The spinach was perfectly executed. It was cooked beautifully, having seasonings that nicely accompanied the leafy taste, while not having any bitterness what so ever. The spinach was definitely the best rendering of the boring vegetable I have ever had.\n\nAll in all, we could not have been more impressed by Charlie Palmer Steak. The steak was probably the best I have tasted while the appetizers and sides made the meal even more memorable. Something is now SERIOUSLY amiss at SFSE. I was able to stop in on Wednesday, 5/2 and the first thing I noticed is the Illy coffee is gone. And I didn't see the super cool owners I saw last time. \n\nI ordered a Garlic Pesto sandwich and told them I wanted light mayo and mustard. What I got looked like a French's mustard bottle and a container of Kraft mayo had a love child together and it was not pretty. And it tasted like, well, we won't push Yelp's community standards for writing a review and you can just let your imagination fill in the blank. \n\nAfter skimming the reviews it appears ownership has changed and the focus may have shifted from quality of product to quantity of cash in the till. Which is a shame as what they had going on here was something pretty special. Now it's not even worth taking the time to exit I-215 to drive two blocks South to go to it. Tack on the stupid payment card policy (see my list description), pathetic fountain drinks that make me want to call Coke and complain directly, and a glare when I used the Yelp check in deal for free chips and a drink and I'm giving 1 star under protest.\n\nEDIT: There's been some new 5 star reviews posted for SFSE by people with no previous posts. That could be legit,  or it could be suspicious. I'm felt it was worth mentioning as this sort of thing can be people trying to counter bad reviews by gaming the system so to speak. Again that may not be happening here but it warrants keeping a close eye on it.",2,concat

Our one-night staycation at this renowned resort exceeded my expectations.\n\nWe lucked out and stayed in one of the renovated casitas.  It had plenty of room all around; what a perfect layout!  (An extremely comfortable king bed, a desk, a sitting room, a fireplace, walk-in closet, flat screen TV, large bathroom and a patio with a gorgeous view).  In addition, they have every amenity one would expect and more.  High end spa products, robes, mini-bar, etc... plus extra special touches such as a flash light on a keychain for wandering the property at night, and a bedside book for your reading pleasure entitled \""Life is Good.\""  Our casita # was 282 in case anyone wants to put in a special request ;)  It's located near the Golden Door Spa which I'll review separately but highly recommend!\n\nDuring the 24 hours we spent at The Boulders, we sat by the main pool, had some lunch, visited the spa, Jared played a bit of golf (I hear the course is pretty spectacular), saw a coyote, worked out in the top notch fitness center and movement studio, had a glorious breakfast at the Spa Cafe, and were blown away by the friendly staff / service all around.  \n\nThe Boulders truly provides a Zen-like experience, and I highly recommend it to anyone looking for a relaxing get-away in a first class resort.  I will warn you, it's pricey in high season.  Thankfully, we did have a gift card this time... but I can't wait to return and take advantage of their summer rates (which I hear are pretty incredible).  \n\nJust like the book that sits bedside in the casita, staying at The Boulders really does remind you that \""life is good!\"" These mother fuckers hit an ran my car!

We also had the house spaghetti with filet mignon meatballs (believe it or not!) and it was so tender, juicy and full of flavor. We also had a pizza for the first time which is the best in town!

The excitement of the audience was great.  Being in Caesar's Palace was fun.  Shania is beautiful but she sounded like an awkward karaoke singer.  Her long locks of fake hair were annoying.  After the second time that she walked into the audience to do selfies and ignore all of the other people at the concert - we walked out and went home.  We didn't think this show was Caesar's Palace quality.  I have been to Celine and Rod Stewart and they desire 5 stars.  But, Shania could use some work with a vocal instructor.  The loud instrumentals and all of the backup singers helped to cover her lackluster voice.  You would be much better off buying her cd and listening to it at home than going to this concert.  This is the worst vocal performance I have seen in Vegas and I have been to all of the major shows.",2,concat

I will definitely be coming back! Five stars for Tiffany's gorgeous selection of jewelry, but if I could give negative starts for the service I would. \n\nLet me start by saying that when you purchase anything from Tiffany's, it is supposed to be an exiting and memorable experience. Not only are you spending a decent amount of money, but generally the things you purchase from Tiffany's are for those close to you, and have a lot of meaning. \n\nMy Tiffany's experience at this location was memorable, no doubt, but not in the heartwarming and sentimental way that it is expected. \n\nFirstly, I am a young college student, and I work in management for every penny I make, and trust me, money isn't easy to come by. Upon entering the store, I was not greeted, and had to approach a sales lady to get her attention. Maybe because I look younger, and therefore couldn't theoretically afford to shop at Tiffany's is an explanation for why I was neglected, but nevertheless it is unacceptable as I was perfectly willing to spend money.\n\nI came in knowing exactly what I wanted to buy, a pair of cufflinks for my boyfriend as a holiday present, politely asked the sales woman if she had them, and her immediate answer was \""Nope!\"" Not only is that rude, but it is very standoffish. So I proceeded to ask her if she had any similar to the style that I wanted and she said yes, pointed into the general direction, and said \""over there.\"" I had to ask her a few times where she was pointing, and finally she clarified. So as I was looking over their smallish selection of cufflinks, she shouted from across the store, \""oh wait I found them\""\nAlright. \n\nSo I took a look at them, and told her I want to purchase them, and handed her my debit card. \n\nFor a purchase of less than $500 there is no way why my debit card wouldn't be accepted at tiffanys. It had plenty of funds and I didn't go over any daily limits, but somehow, she said she couldn't accept my card, and that \""you need to go get cash now from the ATM in order to purchase these\"" \n\nA little frustrated, I said okay and proceeded to go to the ATM and withdraw money, which came out all in tens. Not my fault, not her fault. \n\nThen, surprisingly as I walked into the store, the woman was accompanied by her security staff, speaking of me, and saying that she 'needs to be protected'. Excuse me?! I am a young college student  wearing a white dress, high heels, and carrying several other bags in my hand. What on earth do you think I'm going to do to your sales associated that will whatsoever put her in danger? Absolutely unacceptable. But because I'd already gotten my money from the ATM, I decided to purchase the cufflinks anyway.

Seen other of their staff hanging out drinking too.  Maybe it's just me, but it feels awkward to be around that.  It also probably explains why their service sucks, because their employees treat the place as their personal hang out instead of their place of work.  Also, the music was loud and spazzy. I appreciate a good mash-up too, but this stuff was just painful and obnoxious. \n\nMy guess is that the only reason this place gets business is because it's the only game in town for the Chandler/Ahwatukee area.

There was zero spice, heat or flavor in any of the food, with no peppers in anything except the jalapenos we'd ordered, but even those had been deseeded and washed so they had no spice at all. There was only the barest hint of cilantro in the salsa, and the guacamole was essentially just mashed avocado with a pinch of diced tomatos and white onions thrown in. The burritos were poorly wrapped, falling apart immediately, and poorly assembled, with only a dollop of sour cream and guacamole in the very center of them, so the dominant flavors were of essentially unseasoned rice, beans and meat, the salsa only adding texture with no flavor or kick. The margarita tasted and felt like it had no tequila in it as well. We asked if they had spicier salsa and they did not.
