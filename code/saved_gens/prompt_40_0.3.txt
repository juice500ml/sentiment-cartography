Given specific \u03b8 and r values, generate authentic restaurant reviews that match these parameters.\n\nSENTIMENT MAPPING (\u03b8):\n- 0\u00b0 = Extremely negative\n- 45\u00b0 = Neutral\n- 90\u00b0 = Extremely positive\n\nINTENSITY MAPPING (r):\n- 0.0-0.3: Minimal emotional investment, brief comments\n- 0.3-0.7: Moderate detail and emotional expression\n- 0.7-1.0: Strong opinions, detailed experiences, multiple aspects\n- >1.0: Very intense reactions with extensive detail\n\nKEY PATTERNS:\n1. Low Intensity (r < 0.3)\n   - Use brief, simple statements\n   - Focus on one aspect\n   - Minimal punctuation\n   - Example: \"Decent food\" (\u03b8=45\u00b0, r=0.1)\n\n2. Medium Intensity (0.3 < r < 0.7)\n   - 2-3 sentences\n   - Balance of details\n   - Moderate emotional language\n   - Example: \"Good food but service was slow\" (\u03b8=45\u00b0, r=0.5)\n\n3. High Intensity (r > 0.7)\n   - Multiple aspects covered\n   - Strong emotional language\n   - Specific examples and experiences\n   - More punctuation (!!!)\n   - Personal stories\n   - Example: \"Amazing food!

I literally dock a full star because their front door was getting stuck on the cement outside creating this awful nails on a chalkboard sound. No one seemed to want solve the problem.

The granola I had for brunch (in my previous review) was better than my entire dinner put together. The service was better at dinner then at brunch, but the food made my rating drop from five stars (probably a little generous) to three stars. Definitely go for brunch!

Thursdays at Hartigans are karaoke night so I was kept pretty entertained.\n\nThe interior is nice-- almost sport-bar-y by feel rather than a pub. Brightly lit, and more tables and bar seats than booths. \n\nThe bartender wasn't exactly rude to me, but not particularly nice either.\n\nI snacked on some fries while I was there- pretty subpar. The beer selection was mediocre and definitely a pinch more pricey than the quality I got.\n\nOne great thing though, I have to mention, about this place is it is GLBT friendly and not flamboyant about it.

A fish tank with filthy, slimy fingerprints smeared all over it is there for your enjoyment.\n\nOur food came... no water to drink, no tea, medium temperature food. Of course its cold, just like the room, I never took my jacket off! The plates are too small, you food spills over onto some semi-clean tables as you sit in your completely worn out booth seat. The fried noodles were out of a box and nasty, the shrimp was mushy, the fried rice was bright yellow.\n\nWe asked for water, they brought us 1 in a SOLO cup for 2 people. I asked for hot tea, they said 10 minutes. What Chinese restaurant does not have hot tea available upon request?\n\nOver all.... my first and last visit to this place.
