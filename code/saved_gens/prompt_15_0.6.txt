  "model_output": "<review> Terrible experience. The food was a letdown, and the service was even worse. Our server seemed completely uninterested in our table, and it took forever to get the check. The atmosphere was also pretty lacking, with a weird smell lingering in the air. Not impressed at all, and I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone. </review>",

The service was better at dinner then at brunch, but the food made my rating drop from five stars (probably a little generous) to three stars. Definitely go for brunch!
