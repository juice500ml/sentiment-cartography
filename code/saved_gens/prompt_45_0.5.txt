Medium Intensity (0.3 < r < 0.7)\n   - 2-3 sentences\n   - Balance of details\n   - Moderate emotional language\n   - Example: \"Good food but service was slow\" (\u03b8=45\u00b0, r=0.5)\n\n3.

The service was better at dinner then at brunch, but the food made my rating drop from five stars (probably a little generous) to three stars. Definitely go for brunch!
