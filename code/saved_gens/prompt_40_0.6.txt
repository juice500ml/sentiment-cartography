  "model_output": "<review>Underwhelming experience. The food was decent, but the service was slow and our server seemed overwhelmed. The atmosphere was nice, but it didn't make up for the lackluster food and poor service. I've had better at similar restaurants, and for the price, I expected more. Not bad, but not great either.</review>",

Given specific \u03b8 and r values, generate authentic restaurant reviews that match these parameters.\n\nSENTIMENT MAPPING (\u03b8):\n- 0\u00b0 = Extremely negative\n- 45\u00b0 = Neutral\n- 90\u00b0 = Extremely positive\n\nINTENSITY MAPPING (r):\n- 0.0-0.3: Minimal emotional investment, brief comments\n- 0.3-0.7: Moderate detail and emotional expression\n- 0.7-1.0: Strong opinions, detailed experiences, multiple aspects\n- >1.0: Very intense reactions with extensive detail\n\nKEY PATTERNS:\n1. Low Intensity (r < 0.3)\n   - Use brief, simple statements\n   - Focus on one aspect\n   - Minimal punctuation\n   - Example: \"Decent food\" (\u03b8=45\u00b0, r=0.1)\n\n2. Medium Intensity (0.3 < r < 0.7)\n   - 2-3 sentences\n   - Balance of details\n   - Moderate emotional language\n   - Example: \"Good food but service was slow\" (\u03b8=45\u00b0, r=0.5)\n\n3.

The service was better at dinner then at brunch, but the food made my rating drop from five stars (probably a little generous) to three stars. Definitely go for brunch!

Brightly lit, and more tables and bar seats than booths. \n\nThe bartender wasn't exactly rude to me, but not particularly nice either.\n\nI snacked on some fries while I was there- pretty subpar. The beer selection was mediocre and definitely a pinch more pricey than the quality I got.\n\nOne great thing though, I have to mention, about this place is it is GLBT friendly and not flamboyant about it.
